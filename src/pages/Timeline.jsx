    cardTitle: "The “Pittsburgh Proclamation.”",
    cardSubtitle: "Adopted by the Founding Congress of the American Federation of the International Working People’s Association",
    cardDetailedText:"Comrades! In the Declaration of Independence of the United States we read: When a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Has the moment not arrived to heed the advice of Thomas Jefferson, the true founder of the American Republic? Has government not become oppression? And is our government anything but a conspiracy of the ruling classes against the people — against you? Comrades! Hear what he have to say. Read our manifesto, written in your interest and for the welfare of your wives and children and toward the good of humanity and progress. Our present society is founded upon the exploitation of the propertyless class by the propertied. This exploitation is such that the propertied (capitalists) but the working force body and soul of the propertyless, for the price of the mere cost of existence (wages) and take for themselves, i.e., steal the amount of new values (products) which exceeds the price, whereby wagesare made to represent the necessities instead of the earnings of the wage-laborer. As the non-possessing classes are forced by their poverty to offer for sale to the propertied their working forces, and as our present production on a grandscale enforces technical development with immense rapidity, so that by the application of an always decreasing number of human working force, an always increasing amount of products is created; so does the supply of working force increase constantly, while the demand therefor decreases. This is the reason why the workers compete more and more intensely in selling themselves, causing their wages to sink, or at least on the average, never raising them above the margin necessary for keeping intact their working ability. Whilst by this process the property less are entirely debarred from entering the ranks of the propertied, even by the most strenuous exertions, the propertied, by means of the ever-increasing plundering of the working class, are becoming richer day by day, without in any way being themselves productive. If now and then one of the propertyless class become rich it is not by their own labor but from opportunities which they have to speculate upon, and absorb the labor-product of others. With the accumulation of individual wealth, the greed and power of the propertied grows. They use all the means for competing among themselves for the robbery of the people. In this struggle generally the less-propertied (middle class) are overcome, while the great capitalists, par excellence, swell their wealth enormously, concentrate entire branches of production as well as trade and intercommunication into their hands and develop into monopolists. The increase of products, accompanied by simultaneous decrease of the average income of the working mass of the people, leads to so-called “business” and “commercial” crises, when the misery of the wage-workers is forced to the extreme. For illustration: the last census of the United States shows that after deducting the cost of raw material, interest, rents, risks, etc., the propertied class have absorbed — i.e., stolen — more than five-eighths of all products, leaving scarcely three-eighths to the producers. The propertied class, being scarcely one-tenth of our population, ...in spite of their luxury and extravagance are unable to consume their enormous “profits,” and the producers, unable to consume morethan they receive — three-eighths — so-called “over-productions” must necessarily take place. The terrible results of panics are well known. The increasing eradication of working forces from the productive process annually increases the percentage of the propertyless population, which becomes pauperized and is driven to “crime,” vagabond-age, prostitution, suicide, starvation, and general depravity. This system is unjust, insane, and murderous. It is therefore necessary to totally destroy it with and by all means, and with the greatest energy on the party of everyone who suffers by it, and who does not wantto be made culpable for its continued existence by his inactivity. Agitation for the purpose of organization; organization for the purpose of rebellion. In these few wordsthe ways are marked which the workers must take if they want to be rid of their chains; as the economic condition is the same in all countries of so-called “civi-lization”; as the governments of all Monarchies and Republics work hand in hand for the purpose of opposing all movements of the thinking part of the workers; as finally the victory in the decisive combat of the proletarians against their oppressors can only be gained by the simultaneous struggle along the whole line ofthe bourgeois (capitalistic) society, so therefore the international fraternity of people as expressed in the International Working People’s Association presents itself a self-evident necessity. True order should take its place. This can only be achieved when all the implements of labor, the soil and other premises of production, in short, capital produced by labor, is changed into societary property. Only by this presupposition is destroyed every possibility of the future spoilation of man by man. Only by common, undivided capital can all be enabled to enjoy in their fullness the fruits of the common toil. Only by the impossibility of accumulating individual (pri-vate) capital can everyone be compelled to work who makes a demand to live. This order of things allows production to regulate itself according to the demand of the whole people, so that nobody need work more than a few hours a day, and that all nevertheless can satisfy their needs. Hereby time and opportunity are given for opening to the people the way to the highest possible civilization; the privileges of higher intelligence fall with the privileges of wealth and birth. To the achievement of sucha system the political organizations of the capitalistic classes — be they Monarchies or Republics — form the barriers. These political structures (States), whichare completely in the hands of the propertied, have no other purpose than the upholding of the present disorder of exploitation. All laws are directed against the working people.Insofar as the opposite appears to be the case, theyserve on the one hand to blind the worker, while onthe other hand they are simply evaded. Even the schoolserves only the purpose of furnishing the offspring ofthe wealthy with those qualities necessary to upholdtheir class domination. The children of the poor getscarcely a formal elementary training, and this, too, ismainly directed to such branches as tend to produc-ing prejudices, arrogance, and servility; in short, wantof sense. The Church finally seeks to make completeidiots out of the mass and to make them forego theparadise on earth by promising a fictitious heaven. Thecapitalistic press, on the other hand, takes care of theconfusion of spirits in public life. All these institutions,far from aiding in the education of the masses, havefor their object the keeping in ignorance of the people.They are all in the pay and under the direct control ofthe capitalistic classes. The workers can therefore ex-pect no help from any capitalistic party in their struggleagainst the existing system. They must achieve theirliberation by their own efforts. As in former times aAmerican Federation of the IWPA: “Pittsburgh Proclamation” [Oct. 1883] 3privileged class never surrendered its tyranny, neithercan it be expected that the capitalists of this age willgive up their rulership without being forced to do it.If there ever could have been any question onthis point it should long ago have been dispelled bythe brutalities of the bourgeoisie of all countries — inAmerica as well as in Europe — constantly commits,as often as the proletariat anywhere energetically moveto better their condition. It becomes, therefore, self-evident that the struggle of the proletariat with thebourgeoisie must have a violent, revolutionary char-acter.We could show by scores of illustrations that allattempts in the past to reform this monstrous systemby peaceable means, such as the ballot, have been fu-tile, and all such efforts in the future must necessarilybe so, for the following reasons:The political institutions of our time are theagencies of the propertied class; their mission is theupholding of the privileges of their masters; any re-form in your own behalf would curtail these privileges.To this they will not and cannot consent, for it wouldbe suicidal to themselves.That they will not resign their privileges volun-tarily we know; that they will not make concessionswe likewise know. Since we must then rely upon thekindness of our masters for whatever redress we have,and knowing that from them no good may be expected,there remains but one recourse — FORCE! Our fore-fathers have not only told us that against despots forceis justifiable, because it is the only means, but theythemselves have set the immemorial example.By force our ancestors liberated themselves frompolitical oppression, by force their children will haveto liberate themselves from economic bondage. “It is,therefore, your right, it is your duty,” says Jefferson —“to arm!”What we would achieve is, therefore, plainly andsimply:First:— Destruction of the existing ruling class,by all means, i.e., by energetic, relentless, revolution-ary, and international action.Second:— Establishment of a free society basedupon cooperative organization of production.Third:— Free exchange of equivalent productsby and between the productive organizations withoutcommerce and profit-mongery.Fourth:— Organization of education on a secu-lar, scientific, and equal basis for both sexes.Fifth:— Equal rights for all without distinctionto sex or race.Sixth:— Regulation of all public affairs by freecontracts between the autonomous (independent)communes and associations, resting on a federalisticbasis.Whoever agrees with this ideal, let him grasp ouroutstretched brother hands!Proletarians of all countries, unite!Fellow-workingmen, all we need for the achieve-ment of this great end is ORGANIZATION andUNITY!There exists now no great obstacle to that unity.The work of peaceful education and revolutionaryconspiracy well can and ought to run in parallel lines.The day has come for solidarity. Join our ranks!Let the drum beat defiantly the roll of battle: “Work-men of all countries unite! You have nothing to losebut your chains; you have a world to win!”Tremble, oppressors of the world! Not far be-yond your purblind sight there dawns the scarlet andsable lights of the JUDGEMENT DAY!",

Suit was brought by one Troy Mullins against the school trustees of district in Pike county, demanding the admittance of some children of whom he acted as guardian. The Pike County court denied the children admittance to the school holding that they were 'colored.' being of one-sixteenth Negro blood and under the state law prohibiting 'colored childern' from attending a white school, were therefore debarred. the case was carried to the court of appeals and the decision of that court has the effect of upholding the Pike county court and the school trustee who refused to enroll the children as pupils.",

    cardSubtitle: "First Universal Races Congress Will Mark Its Beginning",
    cardDetailedText: "London-  For the first time in human history there is a clear prospect of one ocmmon ideal animating all peoples, and thus the beautiful old hope of the brotherhood of nations and races is at last moving appreciably toward realization. What better means of celebrating the birth of the new era, of brusing aside the prejudices and suspicions or correcting misunderstandings than bymen and women from east and west, white and nonwhite, meeting as friends and equals in a great congress? We therefore earnestly appeal to all - most especially to symapthizers in the far and near east and in Africa and America - to make the utmost effor to attend personally the first universal races congress in London July 26 to 29 inclusive and convert it into an imposing and world moving demonstration in favor of interracial good will. The congress is truely what it purports to be -  an assembly of members of all the reaces of the world. Accordingly there are papers on China, Japan, Turkey, Persia, the Jewish race, India, Egypt, Haiti, the American Negro, and Indian and the Negro of West and South Africa. Hindu Scholar Will Open Program. In every one of these cases, we wish it to be noted, the paper is written by a member of the particular people or race concerned. while the very first paper of the congress is by a Hindu cholar, the congress executive recognizing that it might thus show its appreciation of the east. Ex oriente lux. It will rejoice the hearts of those who believe in interracial harmony to know that it is not the few, the despised or the eccentric who are cooperating in this congress, but the many, the honored and the experienced. Among the supporters, very many of whom have welcomed with the greatest enthusiasm the idea of holding such a congress and who belong to no less than fifty countries, are thirty presidents of parliament, the majority of the members of the permanent court of arbitration and of the delegates to the second Hague conference, twelve British governors and eight British prime ministers. many statesment and ambassadors. orver forty colonial bishops, some 130 professors of international law, the leading anthropologists and sociologists, the officers of the majority of the council of the interparlimentary union, not to particularize a multitude of other distinguished personages. Henceforth it will be impossible to deny that there exists a solid body of opinion among the most hifhly placed and most highly cultured in favor of just, respectul, and friendly relations between the peoples of the east and those of the west, between the so called whites and the so called colored, and the very remarkable unanimity in regard to fundametals among the distinguished writers of papers will emphasize this. Object and Aim of the Congress. The object of the congress, which will be held in the University of London, is to discuss in the light of modern knowledge and the modern conscience the general relations subsisting between the various peoples with a view to encouraging between them a fuller understading, the most friendly feeling and a heartoer cooperation. Political issues of the hour will be subordinated to this comprehensive end, in the firm belief that when once mutial respect is established difficulties of every type will be sympathetically approached and readily solved. We call on every one who chances to see this appeal to forward the high and holy cause of this congress by becoming a center of propoganda by attending the conference adn by inducing associations and public bodies to be represented. The American auxiliary commitee includes the names of many distinguished Americans like Jane Addams, John Grahm Brooks, President Faunce, Hamilton Holt, George Foster, Peabody, Hon, Joseph Choate, Hon Horace Porter, Lyman Abbott and Andrew Carnegie. The full program may be obtained free of charge and post free by writing to the secratary of the congress. Mr. G Spiller, 63 South Hill Park, Hampstead, London, England.

    cardDetailedText: "Washington. -(Special.)- The flurry over the disposition of the Ninth cavalry is at an end. By order of Gen. Leonard Wood, chief of staff, the colored troops will take their turn at patrolling the Mexican border and will replace the Third cavalry, relieving the latter in order that it may have a chanve to recieve instructions in the maneuver camp at San Antonio. General Carter, in command of the maneuver division, will have charge of the distribution of the Ninth cavalry, and while Sam Fordyce, Laredo, Eagle Pass, Marathon, Presidio del Notre, Marga,Hancock, Manora and other points on the Rio Grande will be covered. It is expressly stated that under no circumstances will they be sent to Brownsville, of 25th Infantry fame. The Ninth will be the divisional cavalry of the maneuver division. The war department will pay no serious attention to the howl raised by a few of the border towns, which do not want a Negro regiment 'in their midst.' Even in Washington, Post has had the generosity to say that 'it goes against the grain of a Texas white man to see a Negro in military uniform, manupulating a gun,' adding sagely that 'it has the same effect upon them as the waving of a red flag in the face of a bull.' The matter of placing the colored troops is always a delicate problem, north or south, and in this particular instance it is evident that the president and the war department are determined to do their level best too preserve the peace, maintain the dignity of the army establishment, and use the gallant Ninth according to the needs of the service, independent of the whims and absurd fears of the bourbons along the Texan frontier. No one here believes that in sturring up this racial embroglio, Representative Garner has chosen 'the better part'",

    cardSubtitle: "James R. Harris in Illinois Chronicle",
    cardDetailedText: "We have on our desk a book entitied “My Brother.” a series of essays and addresses by Dr. Amory H. Bradford. and one of the finest expositions of the doctrine of “human brotherhood” it has been our good fortune to see. With rare insight, the doctor talks of the dangers to society that follow a denial of equal chances in life to all men. regardless of class or race. He reproves The church for her failure to induce men to “practice in their lives what they profess with their lips.” and to our mind the reproof is strictly merited. There is no trouble between the races: there is no maladjustment between the weak and the strong which cannot be lessened by following the teaching of Confucius: “Do not unto others that you sould not have them do to you,” or the positive statement of the same truth by Christ: “Do unto others, that you would they should do unto you.” “The university and the pulpit.” he declares. “are the hope of the world.” This is true. Civilized men are, after all. but cultured barbarians, and the old proverb: “Scratch a Russian and find a Tartar.” is true in spirit of the great majority. We boast our enlightenment—pride ourselves upon our Intellectual and moral excellence, yet In the final analysis, things are largely in the bands of the brass-buttoned gentleman who stands on the corner with a club or a black jack in his hand. True it is, that we have taken the rings out of our noses and we no longer paint (that is, most of us), yet in our treatment of the weak and the helpless we still believe In that good old rule, the simple plan: “That they may take who have the power, And they may Keep, who can.” We have just received the third of the series of monographs being published by the American Negro Monograph company, Washington, D.C. Its theme is-the life of Benjamin Banneker, the great negro mathematician, who did so much to dispel doubt of the negro’s mental capacity in the eighteenth century, and who was not only a recipient of letters of admiration and encouragement from Thomas Jefferson, but also an honored guest at the executive mansion during the administration of that great man. Without any of the numerous tables and other astronomical data, which must go so far toward lessening the diffculties of such a task, Mr Banneker compiled an almanac for the year 1732, which feat won the applause of many of the lending scientists of the day. He later sent a copy In the original manuscript to President Jefferson and accompanied it with a letter from which we quote: “Sir—I am fully sensible of the greatness of that freedom which I now. take with you on the present occasion, a liberty which seemed to me scarcely allowable. when I reflected on that distinguished and dignified station In which you stand, and the almost general prejudice and prepossession which is prevalent in the world against those of my complexion. I suppose it is a truth too well attested to you to need a proof here, that we are a race of beings who have long labored under the abuse and censure of the world; that we have long been considered as brutish rather than human and scarcely capable of mental endowments. Sir, I hope I may safely admit, in consequence of report which hath reached me, that you are a man far less inflexible in sentiments of this nature than many others; that you are measurably friendly and well disposed toward us. and that you are ready and willing to lend your aid and assistance to our relief from those many distressed and numerous calamlties to which we are reduced. Sir—I suppose that your knowledge of the situation of my brethren is too extensivé to need a recital here; neither shall I presume to prescribe methods by which they may be relieved. otherwise than by recommending to you and all others to wean yourselves from those narrow prejudices which you have imbibed with respect to them and as Job propored to his friends. Put your souls in their souls instead. thus shall your hearts be enlarged with kindness and benevolence toward them, and thus shall you need neither the directicn of myself nor others in what manner to proceed therein. This calculation sir is the production of my arduous study in this my advanced stage of life; for having long had unbounded desires to become acquainted with the secrets of nature, I have had to gratify my curiosity herein through my own assiduous applicaiton of astronomical study, in which I need not to recount to you the many difficulties and disadvantages I have had to encounter. We have qunted the letter at length that the reader may get an Idea of the very intelligent way in which this self-taught negro expressed himself. Banneker died in 1804 and no marked shaft marks the site of his resting place: we mention this fact with shame. A people's character is interpereted int terms of its appreciation for its great men, and we hope the day is not far distant when our its whose name Benjamin Bannker lived and wrought, may in some way show their gratitude by distinguishing the spot of bis burial. The ten best-selling books in. fiction for 1910 were the following: The Rosary. A Modern Chroticle When a Man Marries, John Marvel. Thruxton King. The Silver Horde. Lord Loveland Discovers America. The Kingdom of Slender Swords. Simon the Jester and ‘Nathan Burke.” It is interesting to note that of the thirty “best sellers,” nineteen were written by men and eleven by women. Of course, being a “best seller” does not make a book Literature, yet popolarity does not imply a lack of merit and most of. the above given list will repay perusal. In one of the magazines we read an article on “The New Japan,” in which was expresséd great concern over the rapid growth in power and prestige which the island-empire has made in the last half century. Occldegtal nations are justified in, their speculations about Japan’s future. Suppose, for Instance, that she finds it possible to arouse the Chinese from their sleep of centuries, and to inspire them with their own dynamic energies—think, reader, what a power this yellow empire might become! Some idea of the enormous population of China can be formed when we remember that if we could place all the men in the world side by side in one long ine, first an Englishman, then an American, ete. every fourth man would be a Chinaman. One of the sources of Oriental strength !a their impenetrability—the occidental mind cannot see behind the mask, or as Kipling puts it: “It is not good for the Christian race To worry the Aryan “brown, For the white man riles, And the brown man smiles, And it weareth the Christian down; Andghe énd of thé fight Is a tombstone white With the name of the late deceased, And the epitaph clear, “A fool lies here Who tried to hurry the east.” Or as another writer who also knows his subject, puts it 'The brooding east with awe beheld Her, impious younger world; The Roman tempest swelled and swelled. And on her head was hurled. The east bow'd low before the blast, In patient. deep disdain; ‘She let the legions thunder past And plunged in thought again,' The recent magnificent showing by the negroes of Chicago in raising so great a sum of money for the Y. M. C. A. movement simply proves conclusively that in this city the brains and wealth of the race is to be found. This one incident has done more to raise our people in the estimation of the world than all the editorials ever written. A people who can in ten days secure $66,000 for any given purpose must be reckoned with. When we remember that our people are wage earners largely, and often for policy’s sake, are deterred in making large contributions to public enterprises, even when able so to do, the result of this effort is all the more commendable. We thought we were doing a great thing here in Louisville in attempting to raise $15,000, but we take off our hats to Chicago, promising to be in the future.",

    cardSubtitle: "Large Attendance at First Meeting in Labor Temple Last Sunday",
    cardDetailedText: "About 350 members of the race responded to the call of the American Federation of Labor invitation to be present at a meeting at Labor Temple on last Sunday for the purpose or taking steps to become affiliated with that organization. The large gathering and the interest manifested certainly showed the colored man is always ready to grasp even at a straw at it were to join hands with his white brother in any good movement that has for its object the uplift of all people. The meeting was called to order by Mr. Flynn, whose sincerity in his deaire to do the square thing by the colored brother, we hare no reason to doubt. Fiynn Opens Doors to Colored Men. He said the doors of the American Federation of Labor were opened to the colored men and that while in some parts of the country a feeling existed against admitting the colored men, the only way to break down the doors of those still opposing was to get colored men to join the American Federation in places where this feeling does not exist. We cannot expect great things from the start, and it may take a year or two to bring a complete affiliation in all organizations with the colored race. Irish Had Struggle Too. He cited the hardships of his own race, the Irish, whom his mother said, used to be stoned. Now it was up to them to try to educate the colored man and white man to realize the brotherhood of man. You will find the colored brother now in many parts of the country in the counsels of labor organizations as delegates. At the last international convention held here at the Monongahela house, a colored man from Youngstown represented the brickmakers association of that city. McCulfough Lauds Black Man's Efforts .Mr. J. W. McCullough, an ex-president of the United Mine Workers, followed with a vary forcible and impressive speech that showed that his heart was in the right place. He hit right from the shoudder and received much applause for his manly utterances. He spoke of the many wrongs that hed been perpetrated upon the black man, told how they had been brought to this country as slaves. He said the laboring man was now in a wage system of slavery, but the condition of employment today should be this, if you have more knowledge than I, you will be employed and if I have more knowledge than you, I will be employed. The question that is asked today is what is the price? They do not ask Whether it was made by a White man or back man. It is now a question of reaching down to help the other fellow up and as you rise you can help to elevate others of your race. He spoke of the great progress the colored race had made in its ten years of freedom, and is taking its place along side of the white man in all walks of life. if what the race has accomplished in about 10 years is to be considered. you ought to be able to double what you have done within the next 20 years. In fact, there is no limit to the possibilities of the colored man. You will be respected according to what you do for yourself. He said the race has been too contented with work for low wages True, there are places where white men will not work with colored men, but those white men cannot but realize soonor or later that they will be the loosers, and will be brought to see the folly of their position. We all need to get on the same broad platform that knows no creed, color, or nationality and raise the highest standard we can set for each other. Geo. M. Robb Joins Heartily. Mr. Geo. Robb followed with a short speech .to the point. He said he was willing to take a chance and join the American Federation! and that we as colored citizens, have always Been loyal to every movement that the white man has put forward that had for its object the uplift of mankind. While we have been known. as strike breakers, it has been because we could never heretofore be strike makers, but that wé now feel that the Divine hand that carries the destiny of nations has put it into the hands of these men to have us be come part of this great industrial body. The question is. Are we to now members, and is only a question be recognized and acorded the same protection as the white brother! And will your motto be ‘I am my brothers keeper?' We don't want to be used at 'cat’s paws' to pull you out of the fire. Mr. Flynn replied that it was a very difficult problem to get all the white People to think alone. The American Federation of Labor has been advocating for 20 years the same privilege to the colored man as to the white and in fact no organization can affiliate with the American Federation of Labor and exclude the colored man. There are quite a few craftr at present in which the colored men are of time until unions will admit them, What we want to do today Is to get you properly organized and if you have any particular trade to transfer you to your respective organization and if you are not have no particular trade you will become affiliated directly with the American Federation of Labor. We want to see If your people are sincere and while we realize that it is going to take a year of two to get everything in good order and get the results deserved by all, you can start out today for the foundation of this organization. Organization Effected. Mr. N. W. Rickmond was eiected temporary chairman, and a better selection could not have been made. After several declinations Mr. Thos. Wilson was: elected temporary secretary. Mr. Flynn stated the charter would cost $10 and membership fee should be ai least 50 cents. Mr. Geo. Robb, the well known and popular proprietor of the Colonial hotel, whose heart is as big as his body. said he would defray the expense of the charter and present it free to the organization and when the temporary orsanization was effected his $10 was forthcoming. At this meeting a good number of names was enrolled for membership and adout half of the men paid their 50 cents, There will be another meeting at the Labor Temple next Sunday at 2 p.m. Every colored man who has any, race pride and wants to do something for the advancement of his race along industrial lines should be present at that meeting. We cannot see how you have anything to lose and if the promoters of this movement are sincere in their efforts to play fair with the colored man, the race and the American Federation of labor will both reap the benefit. It is certainly worth a fair trial.",

    cardDetailedText: "In looking’ over and studying the various mission fields of the world, our hearts are made to feel sad over the deplorable condition of parts of the human race. The sad tales of India, China and other races, draw forth our deeper sympathy, but when we come to the dark continent of Africa. it is here we take our stand, it is here we hang our harps upon the willow tree and weep because of the woeful condition. and great need of our black brother. The Indian mother throws her baby into the angry river to appease the wrath of her god, the Chinaman bows down,to his image of wood, Mohammedism Claims other worshipers, but when we see the poor black man bound in ignorance, cannibalism, and superstition we feel the great responsibility that rests on us as a part of the human race. Yet all Africa is not dark and benighted. some parts are civilized and the natives are christianized. but that is not the part that needs our help worst. We would find the souls in darkness lying. where no light has broken through. And we need only to look in Darker Africa to find these souls: men and women, boys and. girls who have never heard of the Saviour. whose condition is pitiful to behold. They are ignorant, without raiment and living in superstition, uncivilized: some are cannibals living in rush villages or roaming the forest; all human beings that fall prey to them are cooked and eaten. They believe in devils, Witchery, evil omens: if a snake crawls Into one’s hut the snake is a harbinger of evil. If a native dies his spirit goes into a hog or some wild animal. And yet with all their savagery they are a people that are . willing and eager to learn of His love so deep and dear of the precious price that -------- of the nail, the thorn the spear. Their need is great and we cannot deny them the light of life. civilization must spread over this dark land, Their first great need is the Gospel. let them have the light of salvation. Learn of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. Noble men and women have answered the call of the wild; they have gone forth to plant the blood stained banner of Christ to drive out the superstition to banish death and darkness. but it is not easy sailing. There are dangers and hardships to be encountered is counted not precious. How many today sleep under African sod? Their work was not in vain they struck a blow to African heathenism that made it better. Now it is beginning to fall. soon it will crumble. They have sown the seed of religon, others will reap the harvest they have gone to reap their reward. As we have done it unto these the least of them brethren, ye have done it unto me. But have we conscientiously helped to suppiy the needs of this people? Thousands of dollars. Bibles, books, clothes, men and women. are given to the cause. How great the supply, yet the demand is greater: we still hear the cry. 'come over and help us.' First give them the Gospel, then houses of worship and then schools where they can be taught thrift, industry and skill. instead of the rush hut, build houses. instead of roaming as savages. till the soil To do all this there must be means. The missionary of the field sees the great need and appeals to civilized America to help. Let us look back, over the past three hundred years. We see twenty trembling bound Negroes carried to New York dock and sold as slaves. As the years advance. they increase to hundreds—thousands—to millions. and broad east over the land. It seems hard that they should have suffered the bitterness and gall of slavery. Yet it was God's hand in it all. Suffered it to be so that we as a mass. might be civilized and christianized to better help our fellow man across the ocean. Why was Moses reared in the house of Pharaoh? Why was he taught the fine arts and given such high training? It was God's plan, that he might better lead and help the people, Then we are Zion. the chosen of God. Chosen to do a great work, chosen to save from peril of perdition the souls for whom Christ died, the instrumants of God's hand. We are all missionaries of the Christian religion, pledged to help our fellow men There are, many ways in which we can help spread the gospel. Give of our means, give our young men and women give our prayers and tears. give ourselves. Then while we are Kneeling worshiping God, under our own vine and fig tree, let us not forget the poor African boys and girls that Rev. East spoke of in his letter. without clothes, without a place of worship. and althougd we cannot give thousands, let us give in proportion as God has given to us to help him in hss great work. You that have not been roused to the sense of your duty, do so before it is too late and 'Haste spread the tiding Wide to earth’s remotest strand Let no brothers bitter chidings Rise against you when you stand In the Judgement From some far forgotten land'. The sudject of this sketch was born at Washington, D. C. August 29, 1872, where he spent his early years. He was converted to the Christian faith when fourteen years old and was baptized by Rev. Dr. R. V. Peyton in the Potomac river. Rev. Saunders attended the public school at his native home and received a fair education. Realizing his call to the gospel ministry he made it known to his pastor, the Rev. R. V. Payton, who gave him an opportunity to preach at a trial sermon. After preaching forsome time a council was called to consider the advisibility of ordaining him. Failing to meet the requirements of the council he was requested to study a little more and then try again in two months time. Prurposing to be able to satisfy the next council this young man worked hard at his trade as brickmaking and studied at night. Some time was spent With a private teacher. Things became slow at Washington D.C. in line of work knowing that he had a wife and three little ones to take care of he moved to Philadelphia Pa., where he and his wife worked and saved a few dollars. Leaving Philadelphia he came back to Washington D. C. After spending what little they had accumulated he set sail for Pittsburgh. he was called to the Central Baptist church to succeed the Rey. Dr. F. G. Bookins, feeling that he was able to meet the requirements a council was called July 11, 1905, to consider his ordination. Rev A. W. Puller catechiser, Rev. Dr. R. R. Jones, moderator and Rev. Dr. W. W. Brown secretary. Rev. Saunders received an impartial examination and was ordained. Rev. Dr. Pulier preached his ordination sermon. This young man has pastored several small churches in Pittsburgh, Pa. and vicinity, but feeling that God had something better in store for him he never despaired the day of small things. He succeeded the Rev. J. C. Faulton at the First Baptist church. Finleyville. Pa. Rev. Saunders owes much of his success to his energetic wife who labored hard to help him. working out at day and hearing his lessons at night. being further advanced in some branches of common school. She sat up late with him. Rev Saunders is now pastor of the Bethlehem Baptist church, vice president of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Pittsburgh and vicinity and secretary of the sare. having been three times elected as secretary.

    cardDetailedText: "In order to find out tho attitude of northern colleges toward negro students, Atlanta universfty (colored) sent a circular letter to several hundred institutions asking the names and addresses of students and graduates of negro descent and how they were regarded by the faculty and the student body. Many illuminating replies were received. Yale university answered that it never tried to attract negro students, but never felt justified In refusing admittance to those who came. At Leland Stanford there was said to be no hostility whatever toward colored students. Fordham university, New York, replied that it had never had negro applicants for admission, and if any should come it was impossible to say what reception they would ‘meet. At St. Vincent college, in Pennsylvania, it was said frankly that 'we do not think it wise under prevailing conditions to accept any distinctively colored students into the college.' Naturally none of the northern state universities draw the color line. In Missouri the line is sharply drawn. The president of Carleton college, in that state, writes: 'I have not found a student in the state who would tolerate a negro in the college, and it is even worse since the Johnson-Jeffries fight.' So It seems that while Mr. Johnson won the championship, he did not help the cause af negro education in Missouri. Nearly every year since 1826, when a negro was graduated from Bowdoin college, there’ have been colored graduates from the leading colleges of New England.—Boston Globe.    ",

    cardDetailedText: "‘NOT OPPOSING THE INTERCHURCH COLLEGE, BUT PREFER WORK WITHIN OUR CHURCH,' SAYS THE BISHOP. Nashville, Tena.—‘No, we are not opposing the Interchurch college, we are simply taking the position that all the work which is done by our church for the colored teachers and preachers should be done through the agencies of the church and not through any independent or allen instrumentality.' This is the statement made by Bishop E. E. Hoss in answer to a question as to whether or not the Methodist Episcopal church South, is opposing the American Interchurch college in its relation to social and religious training among the colored people. A called meeting of the executive board of education of the Methodist Episcopal church South, of which Bishop Hoss is a member, was held yesterday afternoon at the office of Dr. Percy  Maddin, also a member, and resolutions were adopted indorsing Paine college in Augusta, Ga., and the administration of the present officials was strongly commended. A communication from the board of missions was read in reference to the enlargement of the facilities for training colored preachers in Paine college and such additional facilities are thoroughly Approved by the executive committee. Similar action was taken by a special committee appointed for the purpose of determining the policy of the church in regard to the training of negro teachers and preachers. This special committee met yesterday also, the meeting being held at the publishing house and Paine college was indorsed unanimously. This committee consisted, of Bishop H. McCoy, Dr. J. D. Hammond, Senator John H. Sherard, Dr. John M. Moore and Mrs. MacDonald. Sitting with the committee by special invitation yesterday were Dr. E. B. Chappell of the Sunday school board and Mr. Stonewall Anderson, secretary of the board of education. One of the most Interesting features of the meeting was an account given by Senator Sherard of a visit to Mound Fayou, Miss., where the entire popuation is colored. The visit of Senator Sherard was greatly appreciated and a paper expressing this appreciation embodied the statement that there was an urgent need of sermons from the White ministers of the southern Methodist church. It was the sense of the committee expressed in a resolution offered by Doctor Moore, that the Methodist Episopal church, South, should operate through the Colored Methodist Episcopal church directly in all its efforts toward social and religious training of the negno. and in all other lines of work, but that the advantages offered by the church should also be open to the people of other colored churches, and especidlly to the Colored Methodist churches. This resolution was adopted. The committee also will recommend that the trustees of Paine college in Augusta, Ga. be respectfully asked to give consideration to the advisabiity of enlarging the department for the training of preachers at Paine college. and of establishing a correspondence school for colored preachers in the church. The following resolutions were adopted: 'In view of the need of enlarging the work of Paine college in several directions, it is recommended that we request the board of education to consider the matter of authorizing the president of Paine college to set about raising immediately an endowment for the college. Assured of raising funds for current expenses. It was also recommended that the board of missions give its hearty indorsement and pledge Its support to such a movement. 'Resolved, That the secretaries of the home department take steps looking to the holding of Sunday school institutes among the colored people. and that as a means to this end, the services of Doctor Chappell and his assistants be! secured in the enlistment of the general Sunday school board and of the conference Sunday school boards in this work.' The question of employing young women. and others, in training Sunday school teachers in the cities was discussed, and the following resolutions were adopted: 'Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that specially equipped and well-trained persons be employed by the home department of the board of missions: to teach and train groups of colored Methodist Sunday school teachers In-our cities; and, 'Resolved. That this committee call attention to those pastors and city mission boards that employ deaconesses and other trained workers to the opportunity which they have in them to help in the development of the religious and moral life of the negroes. and to arrange for such use of them as shall lead to the accomplishment of this end.' The following resolution was also adopted: 'Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that our home secretaries should use all legitimate means to arouse public sentiment among the white people in the communities where there is a large colored population in favor of proper housing and sanitation among the negroes, and that efforts should be made to enlist employers of negroes in towns, cities and country in reasonable plans for the social better ment of the negroes in their employ. The committee hereby expresses its sympathy with sane and well matured negroes who are making efforts to bring about through their leagues the educational, industrial and moral improvement of their people.” After discussing the question of training colored workers the following resolution was adopted: 'We beieve that Paine college should, be the educational center through which the Methodist Episcopal church, South, should at present undertake to prepare colored men and women for religious service. We respectfully recommend that the board of education and the board of missions and the trustees of Paine college consider the advisability at their next meeting of establishing a training school as a department of Paine college for the training and equipment of young women deaconesses, settlement workers, Sunday school teachers and for other religious work.'",

    title: "December 16, 1911",
    cardTitle: "Negro Labor Ignored",
    cardDetailedText: "The David Williams Company of New York City, publishes a weekly magazine entitled The Iron Age, devoted to the Iron and steel industries in the country. Under date of November 25 appears an article written and contributed by Mr. H. P. Bope, one of the leading steel men of our time, and a Pittsburgher. The subject of his article is 'Future Development of the Middle West.' He begins by taking the steel industry as an example. and applying his conclusions to all others. After showing the remarkable progress made in the steel industry and picturing a most optimistic view as to the future, Mr. Bope presents what he is pleased to call 'certain obstacles' which must be overcome, and 'certain dangers which are of tremendous importance.' These he classifies under three separate heads as follows: Legislative, Financial and Economic, the last of which he considers 'dangerous,' and discusses it at length under the head, 'Insufficient Supply of Common Labor.' The writer states that he has had more than thirty years of actual experience In the steel businéss, having worked himself up from the proverbial ground floor; hence the significance of his opinion. He states that when he first entered the steel business, the Irish were the one source of common labor, and he asserts that it was 'the best we ever had.' He explains that Irish labor grew scarce because they, 'recognising the opportunities of this country, sent their children to the public schools,' and the children, upon reaching maturity, belng fittied for higher positions in life, became foremen instead of common laborers as were thelr fathers. And the restilt is that common labor among the Irish is not as available as it was, and he adds, it never will be. 'The Irish. says Mr. Bope, were succeeded the Slav and Hun, but they were never equal to the increasing demand, nor was theirs the best labor, except under certain conditions.' Europe can no longer be depended upon to supply us with common labor. and there seems to be an inherent opposition to the use of the Japanese and the Chinese, since yellow and white do not mix. even in such a capacity. The conclusion of Mr. Bope is that the one great problem now facing the industrial world is that of common labor: and with whe supply of the Irish, the Stav, the the Hun, exhausted and the inhérent opposition to yellow labor so pronounced, he sees a perplexing situation ahead. That Mr. Bepe does not even consider the Negro labarer Is too apparent for comment. That he has no intention of considering him in the future is obvious from the picture he paints. He sees the passing of the Irish. the Slav, the Hun, and admits the impossibility of yellow labor. but, even in the last extremity, he neglects to consider the Negro either as a possible resolt in time of dire necessity, or as a future agency on which to depend when the Slav and the Hun, like their Irish predecessors, have educated their children 'for higher positions of life.' and have been promoted from the position of common labor to the more refined foremanship. The words of Mr. Bape have more than a common significance. His attitude as pictured in his article spells the elimination of the Negro from the industrial development of this country. That such is the policy of the industrial heads of today can not be denied in the face of the slleat rebuke of Mr. Bope. In the face of the past record of the Negro, we ask what has Mr. Bope or the industrial magnates to fear? Wé take pleasure in calling attention to the fact that the Negro has at all times when called upon, shown himself efficient and satisfactory. We have but to refer to the Homestead strike for sufficient proof of what the Negro will do when the white man does him the honor to employ him. From strike-breaking to the battlefield the Negro has labored in the interest of this country, and like Mr, Bope, we measure the future by the past to the extent of warranting the indus tries of the country that when they feel disposed to give the black man a chance, an equal chance, with the Irish, the Slav, the Hun or the European to show his efficiency as a laborer, he will not be found wanting. If the passing of the Irish, Slav and Hun means the creation of a necessity for Negro labor, we pray most ardently for such a consummation; believing as we do in the loyalty of the Negro to his country as well as in his natural fitness for American labor, with neither socialistic nor anarchistic tendencies. Unless Mr. Bope means to eliminate the Negro from the development of the Middle West, there need be no fear of 'insufficiency of common labor.'",

    cardDetailedText: " A recent issue of the Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser calls attention to a speech made by Gov. Emmet O'Neal before the conference of the A. M. E. church recently in session at Mont- gomery. Ala.  It is, interesting to use to note how these colored people in the south get on with leading officials. Seldom or never does one read of the governor of a northern state attending any of the conferences of our people, nor do we read of any of them offering words of advice which will help to encourage colored people to better liv- ing. As a rule, northern governors are never to be found around colored people except when they are seeking their votes. The report of this inci- dent in the far south, however, is so interesting that we are publishing it herewith fust as it appears in the Ad- vertiser: “The fourth day’s session of the A. M. E. conference, which Is in session at the Madison Avenue church, was a gala day for negro Methodists of the state. The principal feature of the day being an address by Gov. Emmet O'Neal, who had been invited to speak before the conference.  “At high noon all available space In the auditorium was filled by ne- groes who had turned out to do honor to the chief magistrate of Alabama. A committee headed by Rev. R. L. Pope, the pastor of the church, met the governor in front of the church and escorted him to the platform. Dr. W. H. Mixon of Selma, Ala., made the address in presenting him to Rt. Rev. H. B. Parks, the presiding bishop, who introduced the governor to the con- ference. A Chautauqua salute wa given, amid long applause. Governor O'Neal assured the conference of his sympathy for and interest in the ne gro ministry He said:  'No class counts for so much in the uplift and advancement of your; people as does the negro ministry. It is for the interest of the white man; as well as the black man to have the negro educated in the sciences and handicrafts of our civilization. To al- low the negro to remain among us ignorant and vile may prove to be a weight about our necks to drag us downs. While in New York some weeks ago, I was interviewed by the New York Journal. In answer to the question, was the negro’s uncontrolla- ble thirst for strong drink responsible for the failure of prohibition in the south, I said emphatically, no. I was born and reared among negroes and for twenty-fve years I practiced at the bar in Lauderdale county, yet I do not recall two negroes who were confirmed drunkards. i can never forget tbe loyalty of your race during the Civil war. History does not re- count another instance where a serv- ant race exhibited such loyalty to the master as has been exhibited by the American negro. I can never forget you. And so long as I occupy the governors chair I shall do all in my power to see that even-handed justice is meted out to every citizen of this commonwealth, be he rich or poor, black or white.’ Bishop Parks replied to the gov- ernor’s address. 'At the close of the reply a reso lution of thanks was offered the gov- ernor.' When strong men like Governor O'Neal are willing to speak out open- ly in praise of the loyalty of negroes and in determined assurance of his intention to mete out even-handed justice to blacks and whites alike they are entitled to our thanks. For one, The Age intends to give proper report to all.such incidents. It is the king of thing for which we publish this newspaper—New York Age. A New Orleans paper takes great pains to point out the desirability of giving the negro a square deal, and refers to many disabilities under which the negro labors in the south and nation. Some injustice may be expected under the circumstances. When it comes to the courts it is bet- ter that the negro stay out of them. The sooner the negro learns how to attend to his business and to avoid clashes with any and everybody the sooner he will learn the lesson which present unfavorable conditions are de- signed to teach. The point is not to be concerned too much about the privileges that are denied and to be concerned about the right use of those which are retained. —Durham (N. C.) Reformer. 'Have you ever thought of it—that great Son of Palestine was a carpen- ter’s son,' sald Dr. E. G. Hirsch of Chicago, in an address at Tuskegee Institute. 'He did not have a class- ical education, but he learned the les- son of life in his father’s carpenter shop; he did not go to academies, but he heard his divine father’s call. Whatever message he bad. be clothed it in the phraseology, not of the counting-room, and not of the draw ing-room, but into the impressive ,Vo- cabulary of the farmer and the ar- tisan. In practicing and learning to practice the religion of labor. you be come Christianized. in the spirit of the great teacher, and Judaized tn the spirit of the great Jewish prophets.' A number of industrious colored boys could find profitible employment after school bours and learn a valu- able trade if they could be induced to put in a few hours around either or both of the local colored printing  shops. There are too many colored boys wearing out valuable shoe leath-  er on Commerce street smoking cig arettes and going to the bad general- ly.—San Antonio Inquirer.   Spend your money with your race. They are struggling to build you up; so belp them.  There is no occasion for alarm on the part of the white people of this state because the negro population shows a slightly larger rate of in- crease. They still outnumber the colored people about eighteen to one, thus making the fear of “negro dom ination” groundless. The negroes, however, cannot view the increase of their number with as little concern, for the reason that it has come about very largely through migration from other states of a type of undesirablee, of men brought here to labor in the industrial centers, who too frequently mistake license for liberty. Coming as they mostly do from Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky where wages are lower, school terms are shorter and the at- titude of the whites toward them is more hostile than In this state, they are endangering the civil and political privileges not only of themselves, but of the entire race in West Virginia. This state of affairs has come about through the development of coal mining and the consequent demand for labor. In but few instances have the law-abiding, property-owning negroes of other states responded. Those who have heeded the call are, for the most part, the unattached, ignorant, happy-golucky element who are the best patrons of the saloonkeeper and form the reserve force from which the population of the penitentiary is recruited. This being the situation those negroes in the state who have any regard for their civil and political status must “view with alarm” this influx and hope that it will either be diverted or that those who come bere after may be of a higher type; otherwise, the movement for Jim Crow cars and disfranchisement will grow apace.—Charleston (S. C.) Advocate. The People’s Investment and Savings bank of Birmingham, Ala, Dr. W. L. Lauderdale, president, closed its doors, says the Birmingham American. In explanation of the trouble, Dr. Lauderdale has issued the following statement: 'By a special call of the board of directors of the People’s Investment and Savings bank by President W. L. Lauderdale, after a brief discussion pertaining to the affairs of the bank and Its best interest, since its robbery which disturbed the confidence of its depositors, the board did not deem It, wise, nor for the best interest of an parties concerned, to continue its present operations, and in view of this fact a resolution was passed calling on Hon. A. E. Walker, superintendent of banks of Alabama, to take the affairs of the bank in hand and liquidate its indebredness to secure the best interest of the depositors of the bank. 'The president and board further feel that In their judgment the bank has sufficient assets to pay its depositors in full.' Thomas L. Masson, editor of Life, recently delivered a lecture on 'Newspapers' before the students of the Glen Ridge (N. J.) high school. The speaker explained that there are three vocabularies in common use. These he classified as the ‘social vocabulary, literary vocabulary and the vocabulary of names or persons. The first, he said, is used in every-day 'chit chat,' and and the second in the schools, but the third, he declared, to be of the most importance. Well-read people, he declared, have an acquaintance almost personal with many personages they have never met. Three sources are open, Mr. Masson declared, from which this same vocabulary may be obtained. These are the daily newspaper, the weekly newspaper and the monthly reviews. The first, he asserted, are so hurriedly edited as to be often incorrect; the second, having more time, are usually more accurate, while the third class contains the substance of the news in the best forms.—South Life Magazine. Among the many race enterprises of Memphis we note the following: Thirty-five groceries and meat markets, 6 undertaker ehops, 3 cemeteries, 6 blacksmith and horseshoeing shops, 10 shoemakers, 4 harness and saddle makers, 2 old folks’ homes, 2 Infirmaries, 1 hospital, 2 newspapers and 2 church organs, 50 boarding houses and 12 restaurants, 4 drug stores, 2 banks, 60 barber shops, 40 pressing clubs, 7 printing plants, 1 shoe store, 1 gents' furnishing store, 1 photo studio, a park theater, 4 jewelry shops, 12 coal and wood compsnies, 1 supply house and 1 swimming pool. Memphis has also to her credit 12 lawyers, 30 physicians, 4 editors, 60 preachers, 110 school teachers, 80 carpenters and woodworkers, 120 brickmasons, 80 hodcarriers and mail carriers, 60 dressmakers and hairdressers; colored population, 52,000; real estate owned by them, $3,000,000. This is not in any sense a bad showing —Memphis News. No lady, colored or white, wants to force her way through a crowd of jostling men and boys such as is wont to congregate before negro paces of amusement rr worship. —Charleston (W. Va.) Advocate. A South Carolina negro, Lewis H. Wagner, having raised the amounts of money orders to bring about his imprisonment, wants to be sent to the federal prison in Atlanta, Ga., in order to perfect an invention, so he says, requiring the use of tools to be found in tbat place of incarceration. If this is true, it is indeed stranger than fiction. Jack Johnson was fined $100 in Newcastle, England, November 3 for overspeeding. His disregard for certain laws hasn't been rectified as yet. ",

Fairfax is pastor, was the occasion for a Jarge gathering of prominent citizens, educators and  professional men and women, srho are deeply interested in the work of the  organization. Besides the principal speaker of the evening, Dr. Joshua A. Brockett, Aladam Noble and George R.  Margetson took part in the splendid literary program rendered. The banquet orator was the Rev. J. Andrew Patterson of New York. the noted author. lecturer and psycho-physical culturist. Dr. Patterson has given years of study and research on subjects relating to health conditions among the colored people of the United States. He has also made careful investigations from time to time of the death rate among our people as to cause, age and kind of disease and the sanitary condition of residence, whether  city or country, in which large numbers of colored people live. Dr. Patterson's address was listened to with close attention. He said in part: 'The signing of the emancipation proclamation by the immortal Lincoln was a long stride toward the colored man’s freedom, but the sudden trausition from the forced simple life of slavery into the unknown complex conditions and responsibilities of freedom carried with it a calamity to the race more appalling to contemplate than the passing of the American Indian. The Indian of the border line of civilization needed to adopt but few of the vices and customs of modern civilization to exterminate him. 'On the other hand, the colored man is functioning right in the midst of a thousand rices, customs and conditions that will destroy any young race. And as a sincere student of this staggering question, being armed with irrefutable facts, I warn the colored people of America that unless something is done to stop this maddening dance of death before the twilight of another century falls the nations of the earth will have walled the dirge of another lost race. The real facts concerning the true moral and physical condition of the race relating to the increasing death rate are little understood by ministers and teachers. who bold the destiny of the race, as it were, in their hands. 'Not only is this generation innately inferior physically to the antebellum Negro. but for lack of knowledge the vast majority is not and cannot conserve its energy. In many sections Marriage is sadly waning. Among those who are married aversion to rearing familles is a scourge in itself that is blasting at the very foundation stone of the future race. 'Of every 100 colored children born: fifty die before the second birthday is reached. Is that all? No. Unmentioned thousands pass who never know an independent heart pulse. 'Insanity is rapidly increasing among Negroes under twenty-five, Consump- tion, or modern tuberculosis, ts becom- ing an epidemic almost as prevalent as the conventional bad cold. Already the young people under twenty-five are dying three to one white. 'There are those who will tell you that all is well,that there is no danger of the race dying off. I ask as one having authority, What will the future be? The speaker told of the wonderful work being done by the mind and  body culture movement and the new health culture which principals, if applies, would soon remedy the present condition of the race.

    cardSubtitle: "Migration and Colonization of the Chief Causes of Amalgamation of Primitive Races",
    cardDetailedText: "A great many modern writers and not a few who wrote in an earlier period are disposed in discredited the Aftrican  origin of the Egyptians, although their color, customs, and other physical characteristics clearly indicate that if any race of people on earth came out of the loins of Uam these did. Nothing seems to be more ceritain to those who have studied the question closely. Dr. Felis von Luschau professor of anthropology in the University of Berk, wrote an admirable paper before the first universal races congress, which met in London in 1911. approaches the subject with more candor und honesty that usually characterize the writings or the utterances of white men who have investigated this subject. While we know or have been told that all the Egyptians are not white or brown or of any of the intermediate colors between white and black, we also know from those who have traveled in that country that the majority of its Inhabitants are black and possess all the physical characteristics of the African. Cause of Distinct Color Varieties. The color of the Egyptian results therefore. from the admixture of the blood of neighboring races with the African blood of these indigenous blacks. Professor, von Luschau says: While the first varieties of primitive man were certainly formed and fixed by long isolation, later variations and races were caused by migration and colonization. as might perhaps best be showed by sketching the anthropology of Africa and the Pacific islands. Just as Madagascar was peopled about 900 or 1000 A.D. by Indonesian colonists coming from Sumatra, so untold ages ago the first inhabitants of Africa came from a place somewhere In southern Asia on the great line from Gibraltar in Australia. No skulls or skeletons of these earliest Africans are as yet known, but we may hope to find them sooner or later. as we already now know a good many sites of paleolithic implements in various parts of tropical and southern Africa. The anatomical , qualities of these first Africans will certainly be found to differ from those of aboriginal  Australians but in tens of hundreds of thousands of years the paleolithic African evolved into a real negro. He  exists in two varieties- a tall variety like the modern Nigerian from the coast of upper Guinea and a small  one    Third Race Makes Its Appearance But I have already stated that we are as yet quite ignorant of the real home of these small races. To these two oldest element in Africa was added  ages afterward, but still in prehistory times, a third one, the Hamitic It is descended from the same ancient Gibraltar Australia line. but was in a higher stage of civilization. These hamites had already a greatly refined language. With an admirable grammar closely related to that of the Samnite and Indo-Germanic languages In Egypt they created more th:u 6,000 years ago the marvelous civilization we now admire as the mother of our own. Ancient Hamitie influences can be traced all through African. In Abysinia, in Galia, Somali. and in Maasilayd  we find even now Hamitic languages or at least Hanitic grammar and Hamitic types. In central Africa. in the region of the great lakes, we have the Hima and Tusi, generally as chiefs reigning over Hantu tribes, often with face and figure like those of the old pharaohs of Egypt. Physical Features of Hamitic Type Even in South Africa nearly 1 percent of the actual Bantu population have high and narrow noses, thin lips and fine large orthographic skulls of the Hamitie type. and all the Hottentor languages and dialects have a pure Hamnitie grammar. Also the pastoral habits of many Africa tribes. their long horned cattle, spiral basket work. etc. are Hamitie. and all can thus trace hamitie influence from the Nile to the Cape of Good Hope. Still there are some Negroes and many, many white people in this country who profess to believe with a sort  of pitying contempt that the African is an unredeemable barbarian. Rev E B L Thompson of Sierra Leone  West Africa in his address before the Negro Society For Historical Research of Yonkers N. Y. on the  subject 'Race consciousness Race Ideal' said among other things: 'As the preponderance of the: inhabitants of Egypt today are of unmixed African blood, we may I think reasonably conclude that these people are of African origin. Otherwise how are we to account for their black faces, crisp hair and other typical Negro physical characteristics?'",

    cardSubtitle: " Memphis, the county seat of Shelby county, Tennessee, founded in 1826 and chartered as a city in 1849, called the Bluff City, 109 miles west of Nashville, is one of the chief commercial cities of the south and one of the moat important cotton markets in the United States. The growth of this city, both in population and commerce, has been remarkable. The population has grown from less than 9,000 in 1850, to 131,105 in. 1920. There are only five cities in the United States that have larger negro populations than Memphis. The last census shows negro population in six cities as follows: Washington, D. C., 94,446; New York, 91,702; New Orleans, 89,362; Baltimore, 84,749; Philadelphia, 84,459; Memphis, 52,441. There are in Shelby county, however, between 90,000 and 100,000: The new union depot which cost five million dollars, with equal accommodations for both races, the imposing sky-scrapers, the beautifully shaded and-paved streets, the costly residences, the 1,000 acres of lovely public parks, the junction of several great railroads, the trolley cars threading the avenues in every direction, the numerous factories, public buildings, costly and spacious churches, add to the, charm of this most wonderful southern city, situated on the great 'Father of Waters.' The spirit of progress is contagious. The colored people of this city have caught the spirit. Many of them have made good. They have been helped and encouraged by their white neighbors. This is very gratifying. As evidence of the material advancement, it is interesting to note that the value of the output of the various manufacturing establishments in Memphis has grown from a little more than one and a half million dollars in 1850 to over thirty million dollars in 1912, an increase of two thousand per cent. The negro’s best friends are found in the south. Here is an instance: In Judge Miller's court room the other day a negro youth was tried on the charge of theft. His employer, a well- known Dallas woman who is prominent in social circles, believed him, innocent. The evidence was entirely circumstantial. She saw that the boy had a good lawyer and she appeared as a witness in his behalf. The jury heard her story and promptly acquitted the negro, for the 12 men were fair-minded southerners who believe in giving the negro with a good record the benefit of the doubt. There is no blind prejudice against the black in the south. There is no race problem here, because the south is soft careless in its social relations. The, negro finds his real haven of refuge in Dixieland where he can always get a job, a square meal and a square deal. He knows the people are not his pretended friends when he tries to do right, and that they will fight for him when he is unjustly treated.—Dallas Times-Herald. Christian philosophy was designed from the beginning to keep the children of the woman and the sons of the man in their proper relation to one another in the home, the church and the state, so that the human race might be perpetuated, as the races be fore the Christian era were not. The thoughtful women of the negro race should study this matter. What the race needs are men, and it can't have them if the negro women their white sisters out of the home family making into the world of affairs where they must cease to be women and cannot be men.—New York Age. The ancient Guild of Spectacle Makers is numerically one of the strong; est of London companies. Its charter dates from the year 1629, and though the exact date of its origin is lost, there is ample evidence that the calling of spectacle maker was extensively followed at a very early date. An old book of 1563 mentions the spectacle makers among other traders, and the biography of Carl Zeno, an Industrious Venetian, who died in 1418, mentions that even at the age of eighty-four he needed no artificial aids to his sight. So presumably spectacles were common in Italy five centuries, ago. At Seattle Doctor Crichton has ordered the use of Puget sound sea water to lay the dust and flush the streets. 'Salt water is one of the best germicides in the world,' says Doctor Crichton. 'Sea water contains several grains of chloride of sodium to the gallon, and within a few days the city's streets will become white with sodium chloride and the action of the sun’s rays on this will produce chloride gas, one of the very best disinfectants known to science.' The Philadelphia Traction company has been experimenting with women conductors, in order to minimize the trouble it has with men and to reduce the cost of operating expenses’ of the experiment succeeds the men conductors will have to go. as the ticket sellers have gone, and the motormen will be in danger of losing their jobs. After a-woman has been a trolley. car conductor for a month who would have her for a wife? The ages of woman masculinity and rule have al- wars been the death ages of nian femininity and rule. Lieutenant Mortenol, a negro. who Is a native of Guadeloupe, has just been promoted captain in the French navy. There are several Chinese officers in the French army, but Captain Mortenol is the first negro to attain high rank in the navy. Some women are so changeable that they never wear the same complex- ion twice. No woman can afford to be a moment late if she expects to be called business-like. The average Chinaman knows how to keep silent when everybody else is talking. The average negro knows how to talk when everybody else is keeping silent. The two attitudes are not the same. The Chinaman learns, & great deal by keeping his mouth shut and the negro forgets a great deal by keeping his mouth open. ‘What a man learns and what a man forgets are not the same. Dr. Sun YatSen, who did so much to make the Chinese Republic possible, and was its provisional president, has been silent for months while the press of the world was trying to make it appear that the Chinese republic was on the verge of disruption because Dr. Sen and President Yuan Sbi-kai were at loggerheads over everything. Dr. Sen now breaks his silence in a Nankin interview to the New York Sun to declare that, personally, his relations with the president are cordial. and that their differences as to public policy and questions are only ‘such as exist between Statesmen in all countries who work together for the common welfare. He says: 'I believe I can safely say that upon one matter  of first importance all the leaders in’ China are of one mind: The beat good of the country. As to how this may be attained is quite another matter, but we are all striving and working for the meritorious and noble end.' No one thinks of a civil war in the United States simply because Mr. Taft, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Roosevelt do not-agree upon matters of public policy. Each of these gentlemen is certainly a true American and a patriot: of a very high order. Yet there are if my knowledge of American affairs  is worthy—many great and vital issues upon which they disagree totally. May it not be so in China?—New York Age. 'Negro Year Book'—whoever heard of such a thing? 'Annual Encyclopedia of the Negro'—whoever thought of devoting a whole volume of a year book and encyclopedia to any single race of people? Here it is, however, and it comes from Tuskegee. No one claims to have shown originality in thinking of it. It bears the name of Monroe N. Work, 'In charge of research and records.' Out of these records, at first only of the students and graduates of Tuskegee, and then of the negro population, this first of all rage books’ seems to have grown. Behind a desk of the Chicago Theological seminary 14 years ago & young negro student, Work by name, sat for three years. With plodding persistence he studied and struggled his way through to graduation. Ever loyal to his race, he eagerly learned all he could from them and the whites how to help them help themselves. He began at the beginning in looking about him here in Chicago, to find out what the actual-conditions of its people were. In the south he continued to look for facts on which to base the means and plans which Tuskegee and other schools for life and work were devising and carrying out. And now from his card catalogue of 'case records' and race facts comes this new and valuable attempt to register the progress of a race in this 'Negro Year book and Annual Encyclopedia.' Al- though it is but a beginning, it is creditable enough to him and his people to mark,an epoch in their history.—Tuskegee Student. A shy man will imitate the tactics of his older brother and wonder if that fellow meets with the same coolness. Five hundred Cuban negroes captured in the late uprising in the province of Oriente have been rounded up in the jails of Havana for safe keeping, as the other jails are already overcrowded. The Latin people like to play at revolution, and those who succeed fare sumptuously for a season, while those who fail, if captured, are very sure Sf having their heads cut off. If the Latin-American people should spend one-half the time in building up their governments that they do in striving to tear them down they would be a great and progressive people. For example, Mexico has lost in the past twelve months of internecine war what she had gained in thirty years of domestic peace. President Diaz ruled with a strong hand for a long period of years, but under him Mexico was prosperous at home and, had abundant credit abroad. If America’s annual candy supply were loaded on one train there could be over 8,000 trucks full of boxes. buckets and glass jars. This load of sweetmeats for the sweet tooth of the American girls costs the consumers about $125,000,000 every year. The woman's work is essentially in the home. The home is the foundation upon ‘which the Christian church and state are builded. Destroy the Christian home by unsexing woman in her work and manners as wife and mother and daughter, and the under- world, the wolves and swine of .the social order will rise up and sweep the Christian church and state from the map of the world. What then? The answer is to be found in the. death of Egypt, Rabylon, Carthage. Greece and Rome before the Christian era. Solomon thought he was de wisest man, but dey is folks in de world today who think dey could give him points in de wisdom game. an’ den, beat him at it With hearts as trumps any old gay deceiver can play a never ending game. Nobody thinks much of the widely advertised self-made man. Folly is what the other guys give themselves up to. ",

Presbyterian church. this city. Miss: Barr. who is assistant secretary of the board. said the first aim of the board is to give the Negro race a good moral foundation. They must therefore first be trained in the Bible and Christian living. 'The board is criticized sometimes,' she said. 'because it does not make Industrial education the first feature. It believes thoroughly in Industrial education and equips schools for the work as fully as possible.' She. described the farm of 1.000 acres at Keyesville. Ga., near Quensta. from which the board is parceling of to the Negroes farms of twenty or thirty acres each. giving to each a mule and a plow and building a small cottage. The tenant is allowed to pay for this equipment and the land by rental fees. so that in time the property becomes his own. 'The, colored people of the United States now own farms' said Miss Barr, 'of such extent as would include all the New England states.' By this statement she referred to negro ownership generally, not ab ue to that fostered by the Presbyterian hoard. This board operates 151 schools. all of them being taught entirely by Negroes except six. The board emphasizes the need of an entirely Negro ministry and supports in part 290 Negro ministers. There are 15,000 children in the board’s schools, and in each one the Bible is a daily textbook. Mrs. M. J. Gildersleeve of New York city's secretary of the woman’s board of home missions, at a study class during the meeting pointed our the wide culture which may accrue from mission study. 'It is a university education' she said. At another time she pointed out the common tie between all the varied peoples of the United States—Alaskans. mountaineers, Negroes, Mexicans and Indians speaking also of the Cubans and Porto Ricans, to whom the board ministers. She said the building of railroads and the development of resources are greatly increasing the missionary’s opportunity. Mrs. S.

    cardDetailedText: "KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 80 — ‘the Migratory Movement has cost the state of Georgia more than $2,000,000 in a single year!  The ‘migratory movement has cost the south a decrease of almost 500,000-people in population The migratory movement  has caused federal authorities to investigate more into the stories of peonage and to use  a federal law to abolish lynching and the use of the mask. But more potent, more: powerful and more dreadful (to the white south) is the realization that with the departure of the Negro goes the political power of the South. Speaking on this phase of the question, an entirely new angle is given it by Cole Blease, one-time Governor of South Carolina. South's Power Doomed 'The Night of the Solid South is a Fading Glory.' Standing before an audience of five thousand white and colored citizens of Columbia, S. C.. Cole Blease, one-time Governor of the State, at a conference for the discussion of inter-racial relations, threw a bomb shell into the calm contentment of the whites by telling them that the scepter of political power was about to depart from Judah. Taking the question up in detail, he told them how they had enjoyed representation in the lower house of Congress upon the basis of population. In a state where the two races were nearly equal in number, like his own, the whites had all. the representatives, though the blacks furnished half of the population of which they were apportioned. With migration going on, and thousands and tens of thousands leaving, the 1930 census will find an entire shift of population, the South having less and the North having more people. The result will be less Southern Congressmen and more Northern, Cole Blease, in all his terms of office, made nationally famous by his spectacular acts, such as the release of many hundreds of prisoners from the state penal institutions, never made such a sensation as this speech. Secure for half a century in political power, regardless of shifts of opinion elsewhere in the country, Southern democracy has wrapped its mantle of power about it and stood to be catered to. Its certainty of continued victory has made it the Leader of even the National Democratic party. It has imposed its will upon the National party through its unity in caucus, And now, as related by Cole Blease, the boll weevil and the migration of the Negro have stripped off the robe and shown it to be just a big imposing shell, covered over with pretense and supported on the skeleton legs of shifting population. 'It was a sober. meeting when he had concluded. The Negroes realizing that citizen rights and even human rights were furthest from the thoughts of the leaders of their states, could see no end to the march northward. The whites, seeing the end of the benighted ignorance of Negroes about conditions elsewhere than in the place of their birth, knew no concessions now, not even actual equality before the law, would stop the stampede, and realized that at last their political system had been weighed in the balance and found wanting, and that even now the enemies forces were thundering at the gates of their moth-eaten aristocracy. 'You may think what you please, you may do what you please, ’concluded. Blease, 'the day of the political South is almost done!'",

    cardDetailedText: "(Pittsburgh Courier Service Special) Wilmington, North Carolina, has set a most wholesome example for the whole South by her recent adoption of a program of. indictment to take the place of the usual program of force to keep the Negro South. The whole state is in sympathy with the new idea, and the best whites and blacks have agreed that migration can be stopped by the South itself, if the two races but agree that the migration is the cause of improper treatment toward. the migrants. Indeed, North Carolina is the one southern state where the races live under a workable understanding.  Lawlessness, crime, mobs, and oppression are less frequent and less general in North Carolina than in any other southern state. As apart of the program of inducement  rather than force, the races at Wilmington have agreed that common justice, a square deal, and a living opportunity shall  be given the Negro who loves law, order and progress. There are a few leading white men in Wilmington who are, not afraid to, accord the negro a fair chance. The response of the Negroes was instant and most sincere. Whole Sea Beach Provided One of the mast convincing pieces of evidence of good faith was the opening of Shell Island Beach, just cut of Wilmington. This is the coming Atlantic City of the South. The Island boasts of 12 cottages, a pavilion seating 5,000, with hotel accommodations on the third floor. It has a beach front of two miles. A hotel proper is in contemplation. The island is ruled by.Negro officers who have been given an opportunity to show themselves friends of law and order among their own people. This is considered an excellent beginning of the education of law, enforcement. This ought to breed a deeper. respect for law and organized government. The beach was officially opened May 30, with Dr. R. R. Spiller as principal speaker. The promoters include such men of both races as the following: C. B. Parmlee, Thos. H. Wright, J. Allen Taylor, W. H. Spront and Robert Norfolk. These are the leading white forces co-operating with such colored citizens as: Frank Avant, Dallas Chesnut, Foster Burnett, all physicians; Thomas Hooper, Rev. G. D. Carnes, A. J. Wilson, Dr. W. H. Moore, one of the leading ministers and John E. Taylor. Mr. Taylor has a state wide reputation for helping every real race movement. These forces have decided to make Wilmington a place to be sought rather than shunned. The slogan is Wilmington, and the ambition of the people is to make the town the leading resort on the southern shores. With such a working force as described above, there is no fear that Wilmington will lose her Negro population because of oppression, lawlessness or mob violence.The names of the men stand for too much in the South to permit even the suspicion that Negroes will be forced out of North Carolina because of oppression. Already, the Wilmington program is being studied by other cities in the South, and steps are ander contemplation to bring together in every large city and  community the best thought and judgment of the two races for the protection of southern liberty and southern industries. North Carolina has set the pace. Others are certain to follow. Inducement and not force, will keep the Negroes South, and laws will not be needed to keen labor agents away.",

    cardSubtitle: "Liberia Today A third Party Congradulations - Negro Education",
    cardDetailedText: "Two distinguished Americans of color have recently returned from Liberia, West Africa, and both are emphatic in their assertions that the black re- public is making rapid progress. Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, editor of The- Crisis, who represented President Coolidge with the rank of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotiant at the inauguration of President Charles D. B. King for his second term, says of his observations there: I spent one month In Liberia, a week in Sierra Leone and 10 days in Senegal. I visited Portugal and Moorish Spain and am tremendously impressed with the beauty of Africa and especially of Liberia and its future opportunities. Mrs. Helen Curtis of Brooklyn, N. Y. was specially invited by President King and his wife to be present at the inauguration on January 7. Upon her return to this country she gave out a statement, a part of which follows:  I had not visited Liberia since my husband's term of office as United States Minister and Consul General, which had been cut short by his death in 1917, Having passed through the thrilling experiences consequent upon the war period In Monrovia, I was particularly anxious to return and see what progress the country had made. There were signs of advancement on every side, and the Inauguration week gave a fine opportunity to see the place Liberia held, not only as an independent black republic but internationally. There were no roads when I was here and no automobiles, Now it is a common thing to have a couple of hours ride on the road recently constructed.  which is only the beginning of a road program which is being carried out. The native chlofe have heartily entered Into co-operation with the government, and in one section built nearly one hundred miles of road upon their own initiative The who legislature, which has Just adjourned, has passed some of the most beneficial enactments of recent years, among them, new debt laws, a law on mineral development and another giving freer access to the interior trade. From these reports by eye-witnesses who have no axes to grind, we feel safe in saying that Liberia may yet take her rightful place in the vanguard of progressive nations. She may yet vindicate the faith of those who nearly a hundred years ago made a  practical move toward giving the Negro a chance to  demonstrate his latent and potential capacity for self-government. WITH the slogan, 'the hope of the farmers and industrial workers,' a call has been issued by the Farmer-Luborites for a third party  convention at St. Paul on June 17. Senator Robert Marion LaFollette  is expected to lead the new group should they decide to buck the old line politicians and go before the country independently. In the last senatorial elections avowed progressives and radicals won in the states of Wisconsin, Minne- sota, Montana, North Dakota, Washington, Iowa and Nebraska. A progressive governor won in Colorado. Some of these men ran as Republicans, and some as Democrats—merely a matter of convenience. In the progressive bloc in Congress Democrats and Republicans alike have co-operated with the Farmer-Labor senators in almost total disregard of party ties. Around this nucleus centers the attempt to build a national third party. It will be seen that this discontent is largely In the West and Northwest. The farmers are dissatisfied But it is hardly to be suspected that a half dozen states can turn the tables on institutions of a half century and more standing. Relief in some way will be found for the farmers. President Coolidge has said as much. To rush matters might cause unnecessary delay. It takes no straining of the imagination to foresee a change of sentiment within the next few months. The voters of the West and Northwest will realize be- fore November that their special grievances are not the whole show. Then they will line up with other patient citizens and give Coolidge a chance to put his program through, They will realize that individual corruption is not so widespread as has been intimated, and that even though certain Republicans have been guilty of misconduct, there are Republicans remaining who will see that they are ferreted out and punished. They will also recall that through the storm of recrimination which we have just passed, the only cool man in Washington was the head of the Republican party. Even the progressives went off half-cocked. These facts will cause much serious thinking be- fore any third party gets popular recognition. And once these facts are thought over, a third party will be still farther from a national foot-hold in American political life. CONGRATULATIONS are in order for Miss Jessie Redmon Fauset, literary editor of The Crisis, on the completion and acceptance for publication of her novel, 'There Is Confusion.' It will appear this spring bearing the Boni and Liveright trade-mark, one of the most outstanding publishing houses in New York, The story, as announced, is a study of the Negro in the North-'the better class.' At a dinner at the Civie Club, a fashionable and famous hostelry in the downtown section of New York, notables, writers and literary folk, both white and colored, expressed appreciation and encouragement on Miss Fruset's undertaking. Carl Von Doren, literary editor of the Century Magazine, and Horace B. Liveright,  of the firm that accepted the work, both spoke encouragingly and urged greater literary effort among our group. Mr. Liveright, who also published Jean Toomer’s fantastic and extraordinary 'Cane,' brought the depressing news that 'Cane' did not take so well with the public. But, he said, he stood .ready to take another chance with any promising and worthy literary aspirant. We do not as yet know what the merits of Miss Fauset’s novel are, but she is correctly praised for making the effort that has proved successful thus far. The Writers’ Guild, an organization of the younger writers, sponsored the occasion at the suggestion of Mr. Charles S. Johnson. FRANKLIN FRAZIER, director of the School o of Saeial Work at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Ga, in a recent vigorous article on Negro education in Opportunity, says: Today Negro education faces a crisis. This crisis is not so much due to the parsing of missionary  and philanthropic support. It is a spiritual rather than an economic crisis. old ideals are inadequate. Missionary education  might have prepared the Negro to live in heaven. but it d1d not fit him for the culture complex In which he finds himself. But the old education in its day did give the Negro an objective.  Negro education offers no objective to the Negro today. Old ideals have been dissipated.  The Negro is either revolting against the old ideals or is adopting a narrow and selfish  individualism. Hence the large number of students who are preparing themselves for the professions as a means to wealth and enjoyment,  and not as a means for deeper and more responsible participation in our civilization. This is a clear cut statement of a question not easily faced. The deeper we delve into it, the less we know how to answer, But what the writer says is true, and we must eventually develop some kind of a solution. 'The old ideals are inadequate.' The Negro no longer has his being purely for the motive of going to heaven when he dies. He wants something more. He wants something here on this earth, in this life— more than mere material assets.",

    cardSubtitle: "Robert Williams, a co-worker in Africa, almost forty years ago, with Cecil Rhodes, and directly in touch ever since with d developments there, read an interesting paper recently before the Royal Colonial Institute in London, describing his observations and experiences in an extensive continental tour last year. Mr. Williams said: 'Since 1911, when I last went through Africa, the black man has been rapidly rising above his former status of a mere laborer, but he may have a long furrow to plough before he arrives  at the stage of self-government. The Sudan is now full of promise and destined to play an important role in the future of Africa and the whole world. The desert begins to give place to rich vegetation, and enormous tracts of fertile land are adapted to cotton, sugar, tobacco and other crops, while tens of thousands of square miles in the highlands are fit for cattle ranching. More than 200,000 acres are now under cotton cultivation and irrigation will bring in some further 3,000,000 acres, a production of 1,000,000 bales annually within fifteen years, a fact of the utmost importance to Europe. Were it not for the sections of the Cape to Cairo Railway, already built, running from paying their way from Cape Town to Bukama on the Congo, 2,600 miles, it would be impossible to operate the great diamond, gold and copper industries of South and Central Africa. In many spheres of work, the black man is edging out and displacing White labor. The lower standard of living of the native enables him to undercut the white man wherever their labor comes into competition. The white would starve on a wage which is wealth to the black man. Is the native to be held down forcibly from engaging in work which lies within his ability, or is he to be kept from rising tb the full height of his power; or is the black worker to be paid on the same scale as the white on the principal of equal pay for. equal work, which would simply mean that all mines would shut down? They would not work.'",

Such is the meaning of 'From Dixie to Broadway.' It took years to come up from the cotton fields of the South to be acclaimed as an artist—something above vaudeville and ragtime. THE ASSOCIATED NEGRO PRESS is writing a series of articles on Negro cities. These are not corporate cities, but literal. They are cities within cities, with no physical line of demarcation, but easily found by the observing sociologist. In Philadelphia, Chicago, Pittsburgh, New York you can easily find 'colored town.' These cities are growing, not necessarily in size, but in character and community interest. They are proving they are not a liability to the town as a whole. May they grow and grow. A NEWS story in-a New York paper reports: Thomas Jefferson Scott, eighteen-year-old son f Captain Charles Harrington Scott, who formerly  lived in Montgomery, Ala., but who now makes his home at 63 Washington square, South, was taken to Welfare Island yesterday to begin an indeterminate sentence imposed by Judge Alfred Talley in General Sessions, following his conviction on charges made by Frances Whalen, nineteen, of 570 Walton avenue, the Bronx. Captain Scott served in the army during the World War, and is said to 'have made considerable money in the turpentine business in the South. His sister is prominent  in Boston society and was one of the founders of the Southern Society in that city. Judge Talley gave the youth a sentence which may run for as long as three years, after many prominent New York men had written him asking that he bear in mind Scott's youth-and the prominent position of his father in Alabama in considering the case. This young man might have gotten his start in this direction in Alabama by preying on helpless colored girls. Or he might have heard others near him boast of their accomplishments, Southerners will yet learn that what is a crime against one girl is a crime against any. THE MOUTHPIECE, 'official organ of the Harlem Economic Association,' has an interesting Christ- mas number. When studied thoughtfully it makes New Yorkers sad. It makes then realize how far they are behind the times in a business and commercial way. Think of Chicago with two banks, several insurance companies and scores of other racial enterprises, while New York has not a single Negro bank and few other legitimate-businesses to make one proud, There is quite a contrast between East and West. GEN. CALLES, the new president of Mexico, says he would like to give Mexicans training similar to that received by Negroes at Tuskegee and Hampton. The Mexicans need it. The great mass of their people are not much further in civilized life than the Southern backwoods Negro. But the tribute to the genius of Booker Washington and General Armstrong is the essence of General Callos remark, Those men discovered ‘the kind of training any backward people needs in this day and time.

    cardDetailedText: "Organizations Protest Deportation of Porto Ricans in Southwest By GEORGE PERRY. . Sept. 9.— (By Coast News Bureau).—The situation in the cotton producers of the Southwest has the political point of choosing between using Black American or the less efficient Mexican from our sister Republic. a bumper crop in Texas, Mexico, Arizona and California, if harvest hands be secured. The Chinese, Japanese and Hindus heretofore the source of labor supply, have been driven away through the strict enforcement of the anti-alien land law. The Mexican is unavailable in sufficient quantities due to the United States immigration laws, The influx of Black American labor is undesired for fear of attracting a parasite class of migratory labor whose permanent abode will be undesirable,  Free from Oriental domination,  yet unable to recruit sufficient  white farm hands to make up the deficiency, the farmers find themselves faced with a problem more serious than ever. Seeking Several Solutions. A solution in the Mexican situation  is being sought through an attempt  to set aside the present immigration  restrictions for the purpose  of allowing contract Mexican labor to be imported across the border under the condition that they are to be returned after the harvest. A bill to this extent will be introduced  in the next California legislature. Protest Porto Rican Entry Another solution is the attempt of the American Cotton Growers Association to import 1,500 Porto Ricans and their families into the Salt River Valley district near Phoenix, where there exists a shortage  of 2,900 cotton pickers. Claiming  that the Porto Ricans being classed as American citizens are not barred by Federal immigration  restrictions, a shipload of Porto  Ricans are being brought in by the  Association. They are expected to  arrive at Galveston within a short time. Labor Organizations Protest. The labor organizations of the Southwest have filed in Washington, a complaint against their intention, claiming that their use in the  Southwest cotton fields will lower the wage-scale to the point where American labor could not compete. This same objection has applied to the use of the Chinese, Japanese and Mexican together with the fact that they are unassimilable, and retard the commercial, industrial and  educational growth of the respective communities by holding back  improvements of all kinds, as well as withholding their money from general circulation. Black Americans Solution. The bankers, railroads, merchants, and moneyed interests are gradually  reaching a consensus of opinion that the only real solution to the problem is to populate the various communities in the cotton districts with a thrifty selected class of  producing Black American farmers. The Black American of all the laboring classes available in  sufficient numbers is the only class that measures up to the Southwest's  requirements. The only objection to him is that he is Black. Nevertheless  Black Americans are assailable  to Americanism and the white man’s standard of living. They maintain the same standard of morals  and living as conducive to the highest type of American civilization. As shown by the 100.000 or more who now reside in this Southwest  territory, the Black American maintains highly organized bodies of Christian worshipers, he has hundreds of good, modern comfortable  homes, his household is maintained  on an independent and self-respecting basis; he is engaged in business; his money is constantly in circulation; and as a wage earner he is to be found in thousands of homes, factories, banks and business establishments, occupying positions of respect and trust without detriment  to the prevailing local standard of labor conditions and wages.",

    cardTitle: "National Negro Health week",
    cardSubtitle: "",
    cardDetailedText: "'The time has come when the health of the colored man should not. be looked upon as a question for the Negro but as a problem for both races.' In these words Major R. R. Moton accurately expressed the attitude of intelligent people toward the health of the Negro at a recent conference in Washington D. C. While much more can be done by the Negroes themselves than has been done by them, it is by no means a strictly Negro problem. Indeed, white people are more responsible than Negroes for the present high death and sickness rates of the Aframerican population. It is because of industrial discrimination that relegates black people to the lowest paid ranks of labor. and housing segregation with its consequent disease breeding, that the black population suffers from a death rate twice as high as that of the whites. Color phobia of the white population renders it difficult for the Negro to extricate himself from this dilemma. Disease does not discriminate. It is encouraging and laudable, of course, to find prominent Negro educators, physicians, and insurance officials attempting to relieve the situation. It is quite time that the problem attracted their attention. Very little, of course, is accomplished  by setting aside special weeks for everything from babies to bananas, save to focus attention of the group and the nation on the fact that such things are of importance. That good health is important hardly needs to be stressed. However, the National Negro Health Week will do no harm and may do some  good. We hope it will. Such work. however, should be going on the entire year. There is no reason why every Negro community should not have a clinic with a paid staff to carry on educational and  preventative work. Any Negro community that can afford a church should have a clinic. Every person should know as much about his body as he does about the streets in his  neighborhood. An intensive educational campaign in every  community under local auspices would do much to free Negroes from the great economic losses due to illness and death, and liberate the masses from their present abject slavery to  useless, if not injurious, quack medicines. This work requires and should have the support and  cooperation of the white people in every community, and the most effective argument to use in gaining their support is the  economic one. For instance, it can be easily shown by the most casual Negro investigator that the whites themselves lose money because of the deplorable health of the black citizens,and the conditions that give rise to this situation. Social psychologists tell us that the intelligence of a crowd is that of its most ignorant member. The same is true with the prosperity of a community: its health is that of its least healthy group. Ten thousand Negro workers working 2,600,000 days per annum at an average salary of 84 a day. have a total  consumptive power equal to £10,400.000, That is to say that these workers can consume food. clothing. shelter and amusements worth that much. If a thousand of these workers are  incapacitated through sickness for a per capita average of twenty days a year. the consumptive power of the Negro community has been reduced by £80,000. Every death of an able bodied worker means a loss to the community of over a thousand  dollars on the basis of a 260-day year at £4 a day. Again, assuming that the total income of our hypothetical community is ten million dollars per annum on a basis of ten thon=and workers and a total population of fifteen thousand, and that the death rate is 20 per 1.000 per annum, the total number of deaths will be 300. If each funeral, including the doctor's bill, costs $300. the total loss in consumptive power (from the viewpoint of local merchants) will be £150,000.  Considering the fact that the Negro death rate is usually twice that of the white death rate. then the total loss in consumptive power to the community, over and above the normal loss, will be $75,000. For a community of 150,000 Negroes the loss will be $750,000. Thus in cities like Baltimore, New York, Washington Memphis, New Orleans, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Louisville, Atlanta, Birmingham, Norfolk, and Jacksonville, it can be plainly seen that the community loses a fortune through bad health of the Negro population. For the country at large the total loss in dollars and cents is tremendous. And mind you, all this has nothing to do with the loss in productive power of the community. Verily, good health pays. Looked at from another angle, a Negro ghetto where deplorable health  conditions exist and the death and sickness rates are twice or thrice as great as among the white population, constitutes a great menace to the whites. Germs are democratic—they know no color line. They assail white and black alike. A germ will fly from a sick Negro to a healthy white man with admirable and un-American impartiality. The relations between the two races are close, both before and after sunset. It is quite logical to assume, therefore, that the white death rate might mot be so high in some localities if it were not for the unusually high rates in the black ghettos.  These are the sort of arguments for Negroes to use in seeking to gain the support and co-operation of the white  people with money and authority in various communities. Talk in dollars and cents and you will get immediate attention and, assistance. Only threats against pocketbooks and lives is  instantly heeded. No person wants to lose either. The white merchants who are deaf to appeals in the name of Jesus Christ will incline their ears readily enough when it is pointed out that their attitude is costing them a half million dollars or so every year that might otherwise be spent over their counters. Nor will they remain impassive when the close relation between bad housing and health and a big tax rate is indicated. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and $10,000 spent for health education through lectures, clinics and sanitary  inspection may save a community $100,000. Such constructive propaganda can be freely broadcast by Negroes in every community (even the worst towns) without fear of reprisal. It will help both whites and blacks. It will create understanding and not antagonism. It will be fundamental and not palliative or futile. Problems are solved by  going to their roots. If those interested in bettering the health; of the Negro population will bring home to the rest of America just how much is lost in cold cash by the present conditions, we shall doubtless bring our death and sickness rates down to at least the level of the white population in the next five years.",

    cardDetailedText: "The great soft coal strike is on. Over 200,000 organized miners in the Central Competitive Field of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Western Pennsylvania have dropped their tools and left their accustomed places in the bowels of the earth. It promises to be a rather long struggle and whichever side wins, the result is likely to be somewhat disastrous in that it will destroy much of the business, of the operators and, may  seriously cripple the miners’ organization. Yet there was no other alternative. Flushed with profits, the operators have decided to crush the workers' organization for all time by their well known methods, viz., the open shop, hired gunmen,  injunction-serving judges and starvation. The miners’ union could do nothing less than to fight bitterly for the standard of wages and conditions of work so laboriously attained throughout the years. In this great struggle black and white union miners are marching side by side. Ju ‘ As in the great steel strike of 1919, the dominant factor in this struggle is the recently arrived Negro migrant who  constitutes the backbone of the industry in the non-union soft coal fields. Thousands of them have been brought into the great soft coal fields of West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, herded into company houses, handed out company paternalism and paid from two to three dollars less per day than union men. For some years there has been a struggle on the surface  between the operators in the Southern and the Northern fields. Under the surface, however, there was no struggle at all, since through interlocking. directorates the larger companies in both fields are controlled by the same people. Great efforts have been made by the operators to develop the Southern field  because it is non-union and because there is a ready supply there of black and white workers, ignorant of their best interests and how to protect them. The United States Bureau of Mines  estimates that from 25 per cent of the nation’s output of soft coal, the production in the non-union Southern field has leaped to over 65 per cent. Thus the Southern field grows in importance while the Northern field declines, yet it is the Northern field and its militant, organized miners with their higher wages and better working conditions that sets the standard for the Southern. If the union miner did not get six dollars a day, the non- union miner would not get four, so on all along the scales of wages and conditions of work. As the situation stands today, the black worker can make or break either the operators or the miners’ union. The future of the soft coal industry rests in the hands of the Negro. With the cessation of work in the Northern field, production will naturally increase in the Southern field. From 65 per cent of the total soft coal output, the production in this field may  increase easily to 80 or 90 per cent. This means that if the underpaid non-union Negro workers in the West  Virginia-Kentucky-Tennessee field, along with their “scabbing” white  fellow workers, do not make common cause with the organized black and white workers to the North, the unions are doomed to defeat. And let it not be forgotten that in defeating the unions, the non-union miners are delivering themselves a body blow since their scale of wages is based on that of the organized men. One of the tragedies of this conflicts the fact that its significance is practically lost to the average so-called educated Negro in the Southern coal field. Or when its significance is realized, this Negro, by and large, is too mendacious or cowardly to give the obviously proper advice. Those that are not owned body and soul by the operators, remain silent for economic reason. Here is a momentous struggle in which organized  laborers are fighting grimly for decent wages, and proper  protection on the job—both black and white unionists, if you please. A victory for the union means increased membership, greater prestige, and a nearer approach to the American  standard of living for all miners. A victory for the operators means an extension of industrial feudalism, the further spread of the open shop, the lowering of wages and the general decline of living standards. The black miners in the non-union field will decide the issue.",

    cardTitle: "Migration from South to North Raised Race's Standard of Living",
    cardSubtitle: "Compulsory Education and Superior Health Instruction Gains Seen By C. S. Johnson",
    cardDetailedText: "By CHARLES S. JOENSON (Editor of Opportunity) NEW YORK. July 14.- Some of the more important aspects of these Negroes may be noted: (1) The movement from South to North increased the living level by exposure to sterner require-  wants were created which higher wages were able in some measure to satisfy. (2)migrant families were exposed to compulsory education laws. (3) Migrants were exposed to sufficient health instruction, examinations, clinics, and hospitals. (4) Child labor among Negroes was reduced from 46.5 in 1910 to 21.9 in 1920 (5) Negro workers have now been in contact with industry about ten years and have in a large measure readjusted their working habits to its demands. (6) In the normal advance to work in industry they have reached those borders of semi-skilled and skilled workers more carefully protected by labor unions. To these unions they are now clamoring for admission, as the most direct route to  work. The strength of their menace to organized labor, which with few exceptions has been unfavorable to Negro inclusion, has been  sufficient to soften hostility. The less skilled lines of the organized work have large numbers of Negro members—the longshoremen with about 10,000  members; the hod carriers and  common building laborers with about 5.000. On the other hand,  carpenters with 240,000 members have only 592 Negroes, and the painters with 120,000 members have only 279 Negroes. Where the unions are freely open to them, they heave been joining with the general movement of workers, here has developed recently a conviction that the future of Negroes in industry and their economic Independence will depend upon their own  capacity for self-organization. This conviction has been aided  materially by the magnificent  efforts of the Pullman porters’ union and the success of the dining car men's organization. (7) As an indication both of the providence of tho group and its potential resources the  Metropolitan Life Insurance Company alone has 2,500,000 Negro  policy-holders, over one-fifth of the  entire Negro population,  representing possibly close to a billion dollars. (8) The life span of Negroes for the five-year period following the migration, according to this same company's figures, increased about five years. (9) In the South the movement away from the plantations of Negroes and whites, which began the  destruction of the plantation system, which has limited ownership of small farm sites, fostered peonage and a very vicious credit system, and kept the  section precariously dependent upon the vicissitudes of one crop. Many of the economic abuses will doubtless disappear with the system, and added impulse will be given to crop diversification. (10) Movement away has contributed to a breaking up of the black belt which, in itself, has held the section in the grip of fear of numerical and political domination. (11)The readjustment following the movement has helped make possible,  through Interest in preserving  the Negro labor supply, and through the attention  centered upon the newer and not unreasonable wants of Negroes, the creation of Inter-racial  committees which numbered some time ago over eight hundred. 12) In the North, and to a degree in the South, the widened  margin of existence, wilder cultural contacts have undoubtedly been the support of the recent new cultural expression of Negroes, marked by their new Intellectual attitude toward themselves, and the sudden confident note in their poetry and art. Linked with the immediate future are factors of promise and doubt. Those workers, despite occasional surface indications of restlessness and unadaptability, are now  established in most of the basic industries and the possibilities are that there will be a constant demand for their services. An industrial machinery adjusted to the yearly consumption of a million new recruits yearly will need this surplus labor from the South. The construction industry alone, which represents about 11 per cent of the workers, requires, it is estimated, 25,000 new skilled workers  merely to replace those lost by death, retired and promoted. On the present basis at least 368,000 new workers are required annually for these places, and immigration from the most important Southern European  countries has been cut down to one-sixth of the usual. Gaps are appearing in the skilled and  semi-skilled occupations &s well as unskilled which have to be filled. As a response to this demand there has been a growing use of Mexican labor along with Negro labor;  introducing a new factor into the Negro situation. Between 1920 and 1927 there has come into the country 353,721 Mexicans. They have gone for the most part in farming sections abandoned by whites and Negroes in Texas and California and into the industrial centers on the work which Negroes were just  engaged upon in 1916 and 1917. As yet there is but little actual competition, the Mexicans taking the least desirable jobs, pushing up Negroes one grade as the Negroes in turn pushed up foreign born, who in turn pushed up the native whites. In many places Negro workers are given a better scale of wages than Mexicans, as whites are in many instances given a better scale than Negroes. (1) The exposure of Negro workers to industry for about 10 years has carried them closer ta skilled _work and its provision for  organization. Thus we have now as a most acute question that of the admission of Negroes to labor unions. The question does not yet seem as serious with Mexican workers. (2) The periods of demand are  favorable to employers’ attitudes toward Negroes, while the  inevitable depression brings mental reaction, which reflects itself not merely in Negro work. but in other phases of their life. (3) There is the question of a  possible saturation paint for a group which does not, like the European immigrant, lose itself and its racial identity after the first or second generation. (4) Increased standards bring  increased demands, which become extremely irritating, particularly with the ability to rent or buy properties outside the old  established Negro residence areas. (5) The release of white workers in the South from the pressure of cheap Negro labor Is making  possible a new labor consciousness which is reflecting itself in the increasing exclusion of Negroes from their town trades. It is a situation similar to the first  release of these white workers after Emancipation. Last year the white bricklayers of Nashville  petitioned the city council to stop permitting Negro boys be taught trades in the schools. Seventy-five years ago the white carpenters of Atlanta petitioned the city council on the same grounds. (6) Over a half million new voters have been enfranchised. (7) There Is the same possibility that Mexican labor can be used as a whip for Negro labor, as Negro labor was used as a whip for white labor. (8) The resident alien labor supply since the years of reduction are approaching the age limits which mark the end of active labor and more accelerated mortality. The demand for both Negro and Mexican  labor will be further increased. (9) Along with this there is an  effort under way to place Mexican labor on the quota basis restricting  the reserve supply still further.",

    cardTitle: "Kansas City Educator Surveys Field of Negro Education",
    cardSubtitle: "Find Defects In Negro Eduaction Also Exist In Our American System",
    cardDetailedText: " KANSAS CITY, Mo, Sept. 29.—The age of armchair analysis in education is past. Experimentation is the only means by which men may arrive at the truths within this field. The writer was very much interested in a recent article in the Educational Review which stated that Negro education had failed because it did not produce men of character and because it  emphasized the classic at the expense  of training the creative industry. Sweeping generalities such as the above are not possible in this type of scientific procedure. Every law and every dicium must be established by means of the most painstaking scientific technique.  When I read the article I wondered against what criteria of success the writer of the previously mentioned article had correlated Negro education. This wonderment led to further inquiries. What values were utilized in making up the regression equation which  determined the degree of success or failure of Negro education? I am sure that every profound student of the question will agree with me that some such technique as the  regression equation would be  necessary to fully determine whether or not Negro education had failed. If we are permitted to philosophize on the question, it appears to the writer that such a question are the relative failure or success of this or that type of education is far from being answered at the present time, because of the many variables in education, and because it is now  impossible at the present time to set up reliable and consistent criteria of success. The writer's definition of  'Standard of Living' is as loose and as meaningless as his other  generalities. The standard of living may be expressed and measured in terms of units of cost of living. All goods, cultural and economic, are  purchased in cost of living units, While readers of this article may disagree in a measure with this understanding of the connection between the standard of living and the cost of living, it is nevertheless true that statistically the only way to  measure the standard of living is through the cost of living. The cost of living is contingent upon income; for it is a known fact that the  correlation between the cost of living and income is nearly unity. Thus, it is seen that as the income increases the cost of living goes up, and consequently, the standard of living; and as the income decreases, the cost of living falls and also the standard of living. It is very true that a group which has a low income has a low purchasing power of economic goods and consequently, a low standard of living. However, there are many more variables than the skill of the Negro worker which enter in as casual factors in determining the relatively high or low incomes of Negro men and women. The various ramifications and manifestations of race prejudice and caste, taboos, and the law of supply and demand for labor, trade union practices, and inability to get training in certain occupations, all tend to increase or decrease the amount of money which the Negro worker is able to make. In our economic system, therefore, high salaries and wages are the results of  a complex of interdependent variables. Thus, it is seen that the Negro might have an abundance of skilled artisans, and yet, his income would not be increased in direct proportion to the number of skilled artisans. There are many illustrations of this fact. During the war many skilled Negroes reported for work at the various shipyards in the eastern seaboard, and yet, in the majority of instances, they were turned away for various reasons. Thus, it is seem it would be erroneous to argue that a high income is absolutely contingent in all cases upon skill and efficiency. Many avenues or channels may be opened to the black youth for training him to be a skilled artisan, but until such factors as prejudice, supply and demand, caste, taboos, trade union practices, etc., are swept aside, there is no assurance that the income of the American Negro will be increased. The writer of the aforementioned article states that Negro schools with tow notable exceptions, Hampton and Tuskegee, are merely preparatory agencies for the professional schools-for each such work as teaching, ministry, law, dentiatry, etc. I am sure that the writer was not aware of the fact that fully 75 per cent of the graduates of Hampton enter the teaching profession and that a very large proportion of the graduates of both of these schools do not follow industrial pursuits. In a study made by the Bureau of Negro  Economics in in New York City a few years ago, it was shown that a large proportion of the  Negroes trained in the technical and trade schools did not follow in subsequent life the trades for which they had been trained. The reasons for this have been pointed out in the above discussion. Furthermore, a boy may be trained for a trade, and yet there is no assurance that he will be efficient in his trade or that he will have any desire to follow the trade. This is true in particular because there is a vast difference in the trade situation in life and the training which a youth receives in school. The Negro has selected the professional courses for a number of obvious reasons. The professions offer him the only occupational opportunity. By entering the professions he is endeavoring to escape from the  clutches of class and racial industrial discrimination. The cut-throat competition which exists in the skilled trades affects the Negro to such an extent that entrance into these pursuits in many instances is an impossibility. The Negro parent, in his desire to better the condition of his child in the mazes of American racial complexes, has tended to look upon the professions as the  only means of escape and as the only means of enjoying an economic status along with other American groups.  It is true that Negro institutions of higher learning are, in many instances, turning out misfits. However this is due to the fact that the principals of vocational and educational guidance are still little understood. Then too there are not larger percentages of misfits coming out of Negro institutions of higher learning than there are coming out of other institutions of higher learning. The Negro college along with the white college will have to await the coming of a better understood guidance technique before it can hope to attain one hundred percent of success in preparing its students for life. The crying need in American education today is experimentation technique which will enable the school to turn out boys and girls who have been educated for life. There is no question in the mind of the writer but that the ills of the Negro educational system are also the ills of the American educational system in general. The time is at hand when we will have to reconstruct our curricula so that we will have a high degree of assurance that boys and girls will be fitted for life in school. In so far as the Negro has been able-due to the complexity of the situation in which he finds himself- he has advanced, and the only reason that he has not the same income today as other racial groups in America is because his situation is far more complicated by a large number of uncontrollable factors. During the war, studies by the department of labor in the comparative cost of living and income of Negro and white workers showed conclusively that when given an opportunity the Negro worker had as high an income as other workers, and that he spent the same proportion of his income for the various factors which enter into the standard of living as other racial groups. Hence, it must be borne in the mind that a remedy which will effect and increase in the income of the Negro lies not only in a scientific transformation of his educational program but also in transformations which must take place all down the line in the political, social, and economic maelstrom in which he struggles.",

    cardSubtitle: "Discovers Negro Was Mexican President in 1825",
    cardDetailedText: "NEW YORK, N. Y., Nov. 25.— J.A Rogers, the well known Negro author and journalist who has been in Europe for the past year, has unearthed some very interesting information about Vicente Guerrero, Liberator of Mexico, While in Paris he ran across a description of Guerrero in Larousse, This French encyclopedia, that he was 'esclave mulatre,' meaning 'mulatto slave.' In the December number of the Messenger, a Negro monthly magazine published in New York City, Mr. Rogers tells the interesting story of this great man who would  be Jim-crowed if he lived in the United States today. Says Rogers: 'A singular fact about Guerrero: he could neither read nor write, but like Crispus Attucks, illiterate Negro slave and the first to strike the blow for American independence he could feel deeply, perhaps 4 the more because he to was an escaped slave-the tyranny of Spain-a tyranny that caused her the loss of all her colonies of every single foot of the vast possession she once held in the New World.' Writer then relates the  oppression and taxation that led up to the revolt of the Mexicans against Spain and how the oppressed, led by Guerrero and others threw off the Spanish yoke. After many internal struggles in which leaders arose and were overthrown Guerrero was elected president in 1825. Then we are told: 'Guerrero at once set about improving the condition of the masses composed largely of Indians and half-breeds.He ordered school to be build and established free libraries. Reading had been forbidden by the Spaniards, and the inquisition had been active. Guerrero further established a coinage, regulated the gambling houses, and ordered a suspension of the death penalty. But that was not all. He had been inspired by the American constitution but going further than that document he ordered the immediate freedom of every slave in the republic. A reading of the Mexican Constitution, much of it the work of Guerrero, shows it to be one of the most liberal in existence. 'Guerraro's emancipation proclamation passed almost unnoticed because chattel slaves were few -all except in one part of the republic where Americans who had Migrated into Mexico under the leadership of Stephen Austin. The land had been granted them by the Spanish victory, and they had sought there a haven from the agitation against slavery then going on in their own land. The slaveholders had jumped from the frying pan into the fire.' Thus, a Negro slave became the George Washington of Mexico.",

    cardTitle: "Now its the Mexican",
    cardSubtitle: "",
    cardDetailedText: "In order to be assured of a supply of cheap labor and thus keep production costs low and profits as high as possible,  employers have always favored immigration. First, it was the serfs and convicts of Europe who were brought to this  country and sold into indentured slavery. This supply of cheap labor was augmented by black slaves captured or bought in Africa and brought over in the foul-smelling holds of ships owned by the pious mariners of New England. Following them came the Irish, the Germans, the Italians, the Poles and finally the Russian Jews. Now it is the Mexicans. Each group as it has arrived, has for some time enabled the employers to keep production costs down and profits up, but each group has, in turn caused a social problem, that, so far as the nation is concerned, has been very costly and proved somewhat of an obstacle to the attainment of that homogeneity which some thoughtful people feel desirable. The  competition of slave and free labor caused hundreds of thousands of 'poor whites' to retreat to the mountainous districts of the Appalachians and vegetate there for generations in sloth,  ignorance and idleness, and result in the Civil War. Each  followings wave of immigration caused social schisms, enhanced prejudices of race, nationality and religion, and slowed up the process of assimilation. Time and opportunity are necessary before an alien group, especially an exploited laboring group, can be absorbed into the social body. In the meantime there are all sorts of delicate problems, which are reflected in the opposition to a Catholic or,Jew for President, the opposition to the granting of social equality to Negroes, and the  prejudice against citizens of foreign extraction not sufficiently far removed. Some contend that immigration of these masses of laborers from foreign lands has been beneficial to the United States because it has made for tolerance, independence and love of liberty. In view of all of the prejudices on tap in the United States at present; however, it can hardly be contended that there is more prejudice, bigotry and freedom among homogeneous peoples like the Finns, the Swedes and the Danes, than there is in our heterogeneous population. So far as the Negro is concerned, it is exceedingly  doubtful whether he has been benefited by these successive waves of foreign labor. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that the economic progress of our group has been hindered by  immigration. As proof, one has only to point to the great strides made by Negroes, in all classes, since European  immigration has been so markedly curtailed. This is especially noticeable in the North and East, where, despite the present temporary period of unemployment, the Negro has more  industrial opportunities than at any time since the Civil War. And he might have a great deal more if it were not for the opposition of most of this foreign laboring element who but a few Years before came humbly to this country seeking work and opportunity. Heretofore the Negros losing competition with  low-standard foreign labor has been in the North and East, but now comes competition of a similar sort in his old stronghold: the South. In the past ten years well over a million and a half Mexicans have entered the Southwestern states seeking work. They were encouraged originally by the employers seeking cheap labor and high profits. Their coming has not been an unmixed blessing. While the Mexican has worked for lower wages, he has, like all preceding groups, brought a social problem. Social agencies and civil authorities have  suddenly come to realize that cheap labor is costly in taxes. Low wages means low living, and low living means squalor,  disease, crime and high death rate. So the cry has gone up to restrict Mexican immigration just as the entrance of all other foreign laboring groups is now rigidly restricted. Consequently a great deal of propaganda is being circulated against the lowly Mexican. While we agree that the entrance of Mexican labor should be restricted just as all other alien labor is, we register a strong objection to the tone of the propaganda being broadcasted. Instead of placing the blame squarely on the selfish employers who paid, and still pay, these Mexicans the lowest wages possible, the contention is now advanced that the Mexican is diseased, criminally inclined, cannot he assimilated and is about to cause another race problem. Of course this is all nonsense. What is being said of the Mexican peons today was said of every successive wave of immigrants and is still being said about the Negro. Other groups like the Irish, Jews. Germans, Greeks and so forth, have been or are being assimilated and have reached the American standard of living, so why not the Mexican, in time? There is only one valid ground on which agitation against further immigration of Mexican labor should. be opposed by us: economic competition. The Negro is in no position to stand it, being himself the lowest economic group. For that reason, and for that reason alone, he should align himself with the forces favoring restriction of labor immigration from the southern republic.",

Quoting the statistics on sickness and death among Negroes in  comparison to the whites, Miss  Jannath points out the singular fact that while 'The Negro is  constitutionally the superior of the white man having better eyes, a more  resistant skin, more stable nerves and better metabolism' nevertheless  Negroes are dying proportionately faster than white folks and are cursed with more sickness. This, the writer points out is not so much due to congestion or bad sanitation as it is to faulty diet. If the Negro ate properly he could very shortly reduce his death and sickness rates below that of the white citizens, but instead he insists on a diet consisting largely of pork, black-eyed peas, corn bread, coffee, fried dishes, hot biscuits, rolls and all sorts of greasy preparations. In the course of her illuminating  discussion of the subject, the author takes occasion to rap the Germ  Theory of disease, to deny that  anything is known about Tuberculosis. and to charge that there has been no real advance in medical science.

V,, Aug. 30.— Warning against the spread North of Southern institutions  prejudicial to the Negro masses and  pointing out that the only hope of the Negro is to organize as workers and strengthen their power by  alliance with those sections of the  exploited white workers who are ready for such an alliance,  leaders of the American Negro Labor Congress received tremendous  ovations from & large crowd of Negro workers who attended the  organization’s mass meeting last Friday night at Boyle's Mem. M. E. Zion Church, Gates avenue and Irving Place, Brooklyn. 'Yon can talk until doomsday about freedom,' Righard B. Moore, National Organizer of the A. N. L. C., told the meeting, 'you can talk until doomsday about  emancipation, but unless you organize the only class which has the power and the will to struggle for  emancipation, your talk is useless. Must Organize Labor Power 'Not until the Negro masses  organize their labor power and unite with other oppressed groups and classes will we win our freedom. The only hope of the Negro is to organize as workers and strengthen  their power with an alliance with the class-conscious white  workers of America and the white, brown and yellow workers of the world.' Describing the American Negro Labor Congress as the basic Negro organization, fighting at the point where life is maintained, fighting for better wages, better conditions of labor, equal pay for equal work, and against all inequalities:  political, social or economic, the A. N. L. C. head warned his hearers that there were two groups of white workers: these who still had the ideology of the bosses and aided the bosses in practicing  discrimination against colored workers, and those who had learned in the school of revolutionary activity that the interests of all workers, black, white and brown, were identical and were ready to make common cause with all sections of the working class. 'The A. N. L, C, is organized to smash the barriers raised against us in the trades unions by the first group and to force equal pay for equal. work, equal opportunity for employment and equal representation in the unions,' Moore concluded. Haitian Praises ANLC Henry Rosemond, secretary of the Haitian Patriotic Union and a member of long standing in the A. N. L. C, urged upon the meeting the necessity of a militant organization like the A. N. L. C. and especially called upon those present to strengthen the Brooklyn Council of the A. N. L. C. by becoming active members. Miss Grace Campbell, chairman of the Harlem Educational Forum, gave a brief outline of working conditions among Negro women in the needle trades and other industries. Raps Old Political Parties Declaring that the Republican Party had betrayed the Negro and reminding his hearers of the  traditional enmity of the Democratic Party, George Padmore, an  associate editor of the 'Negro  Champion,' called upon the Negro voter to cast a protest vote against both old parties and to votes for a  working-class ticket. He also  castigated Judge Atwel for his  prejudiced attitude in a recent case  before him and warned that Atwel is not individual. There are scores of other Atwels come up from the South trying to introduce  Southern prejudice and Southern  institutions in the North. We must meet this growing menace by eternal vigilance end by effective  working-class organization. Declaring that the A. N. L.

    cardDetailedText: "NEGRO SLAVE was the George Washington and the Lincoln combined of Mexico. And he was also its second president. Mexico, at that time, was larger than the United States. Vicente Guerrero was born at Ixtla, Mexico, 1782. His father was Juan Pedro Guerrero and mother. Maria Guadelupe-Saldand, of mixed and Indian parentage. Perhaps there was a white strain for he is often referred to as a half-caste, and Larousse, foremost French encyclopedia speaks of him as a 'mulatto slave' (esclave, mixtre) 'who led the fight for Mexican independence.' Guerrero began life as a mule-driver, His people were the lowest of the low, They were degraded by law, custom and prejudice; and hindered in every way from rising. Unlike Lincoln, Guerrero hadn't the slightest chance to learn to read. He was nearly forty before he knew a letter of the alphabet,. In 1810 when Guerrero was twenty-eight, the struggle for Mexican independence began, led by a valiant priest, named Hidalgo. The Mexicans were heavily taxed by Spain, all commerce with other countries was forbidden, as well as all home manufacture. Hidelo planted grape vines to make his own wine and the Spanish government tore them up. Wine must be bought from Spain. At this time too, the Mexicans were called on to pay an additional tax of forty-five million dollars—an enormous sum those days—to Spain. Really the complaint that the American  colonists had against King George was nothing in comparison with that that the Mexicans had against the king of Spain. GUERRERO DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF Hidalgo declared the independence of his country and called on all Mexicans to follow him. Among the first to respond was Guerrero. In the first battle Guerrero distinguished himself, and was made captain, Armed almost only with pitch forks the Mexicans, most of whom, like Guerrero, came from the lowest element, were victorious. Among the number was also another Negro who is described by Villasenor, Mexican historian, as being 'very black, of horrible appearance and extraordinary bravery.' His name was Juan del Carmen. Later he was made a colonel and  became the close friend and supporter of Guerrero until killed in battle. The Mexicans were at first, successful but finally gave way before the Spaniards. One by one the leaders, Hidalgo, Morelos, Allende,  Aldama, Jiminiz, Mina, were captured and’  beheaded, Others accepted the king's pardon. All but one: Guerrero. 'Forsaken by  fortune, betrayed, without money, without arms,' says Villasenor, with only His will power left, he was at this time of desolation and despair the only supporter of the cause of independence, causing to shine forth his valor, prudence, profound  sagacity, indefatigable activity, and heroic constancy.' 'Even in the darkest days of the long revolution,'  says Rives, 'he was the leader of a little body of unconquered men, who kept alive the cause of independence.' 'The government even sent his father, Pedro, to plead with him, offering him lands and wealth, but Guerrero was firm. He had pledged himself not to rest until the hated Spaniard was driven into the sea. He never spared the life of a  Spaniard nor asked for mercy from one. GUERRERO WINS TWO BATTLES Finally the Spaniards sent Gen, Iturbide after him. Guerrero whipped Iturbide in two battles. Iturbide had high ambitions. He wanted to rule Mexico. He had bought up the army, but  Guerrero was in his way. He arranged with Guerrero for a parley, during which he told Guerrero that he had had a change of heart, that he believed the Mexicans were right, and would come over to them if  Guerrero would side with him. The latter, placing full faith in-him, agreed, The Spanish government yielded. Guerrero, who ,sought nothing for himself, named Iturbide head of the Mexican republic. But no sooner had Iturbide got Into power than he began to show his true colors. What he did then is  probably the cause of all the disturbance that exists in Mexico even to this day. A royalist at heart, Iturbide named himself emperor and continued the oppression of the masses. Guerrero, whose great aim was the liberation of the masses, declared war. against Iturbide, who was captured and executed. A new president was elected, with Guerrero vice-president. With the Spaniards now out, the struggle in Mexico took another shape: that between the landed classes and the masses. Freemasonry at this time invading Mexico the poor took the York rites, and the rich the Scottish rites. Guerrero,  always a man of the common people, was named head of the York lodge. The time came for another  election, with two candidates for the presidency: Guerrero and Pedraza. Every effort was made by the  common people to elect Guerrero, while the rich did their best for Pedraza. Finally 10 legislators declared for Pedraza, electing him. Guerrero got only eight. There was no manhood suffrage. At this news revolt broke out all over the nation, and a proclamation was issued naming Guerrero president. It ran: 'The name of the Hero of the south is repeated with unspeakable enthusiasm. His valor and constancy  combined have engraved themselves  upon.the hearts of the Mexican  people. He Is the image of their felicity, They wish to confide to him the delicate and sacred task of executive power.' MADE PRESIDENT Three days later the government surrendered, offering to make Guerrero  minister of war.’ But the people  wanted him as head of ‘the nation,  and the Mexican congress passed a law making him so. In April, 1823, he was inaugurated. Guerrero at once set about improving  the condition of the masses, composed  largely of Indians, half-breeds, and a small percentage of Negroes. He ordered schools to be built,  established free libraries, declared  religious-liberty—reading had been  forbidden: established a coinage,  suspended the death penalty, and took other steps far In advance of his time. But that was not all. Guerrero had been inspired by the American constitution, But he went further. He ordered the immediate liberation of every slave in the  republic. A reading of the Mexican constitution, much of it the work of shows it to be as liberal as any that was ever penned. One of its clauses reads: 'All inhabitants, whether white,  African or Indian, are qualified to hold office.' Guerrero's emancipation proclamation was carried out into effect almost without disturbance, because chattel slaves were comparatively few. In one part of the republic however, it made a tremendous stir and that was Texas. The Texans were Americans who had migrated into Mexico, headed by Stephen Austin. They had come there to escape anti-slavery agitation in the United States. Now, they had jumped from the frying pan into the the fire. Guerréro,’ however, was unable to enforce his decree in Texas. He was busy fighting his enemies in the  capital, but the good work he had  started bore fruit, and the slaves there were freed a few years later. Guerrero's emancipation proclamation,  it must be noted, was more  effective than Lincoln's. Lincoln’ freed, only those slaves In territory held by the Confederates. The African slaves were really freed by the 13th amendment, which was passed after Lincoln's death. Had Lincoln lived it is extremely doubtful whether the Slaves would have been freed when they were, Lincoln was a conciliator,  not a destroyer of slavery. and had he lived the slaves would, in all probability, have been held another five or six years In apprenticeship to their masters, as had been the case in all the British dominions, in Brazil, and elsewhere. GREATER THAN LINCOLN Hence, Guérrero was something more than a Lincoln. He was, too, as beautiful a character  as Lincoln. Guerrero sought nothing for himself. 'Iturbide,' says Bancroft, noted historian, 'owed his position to. the abnegation without limit to the patriotic virtues of Guerrero. He adds: 'He was possessed of a gentleness and magnetism that  inspired love among his adherents: while his swarthy face, resonant voice and flashing eye made him an objects of profound respect even among his enemies.' 'Not - even his enemies' says George Creel, 'denied his patriotism, courage and incorruptible honesty.' Guerrero, In power, had formidable enemies among the landed classes.’ Nearly all of them were men of education while he could barely read But, lacking education, he possessed heart, generosity and a forgiving spirit. These were his undoing, for the time called for hard-handedness. Finally he was driven out of power as being incapable. 'The rebels,' says Baneroft, 'could not bear the sight of ope of Guerrero race occupying the presidential chair, Fleeing into the mountains, Guerrero gathered an army, and for four years defeated every force sent against him, although he had been weakened by a ball that had lodged in his chest while fighting Iturbide. Finally his rival, Gert. Bustamente, bribed a ship captain, named Picaluga,  to entice Guerrero on his ship and sail off with him. Plealuga and Guerrero were old friends. Accepting. the invitation to come on board, Guerrero was taken to a port and handed over to Bustamente. After a mock trial, he was shot and killed. At news of his death a wave of anger swept over the Mexican people.  Bustemente was driven from the presidency and was forced, to flee for his life. Piceluga, who bad received $15,000 for his treachery- a great sum those days—was sentenced to death. A pension was paid Guerrero’s widow;  honors were conferred on the rest of his family; cities and a state were named in his honor; and in 1842 his body was removed to, Mexico City,  where the highest honors were paid his memory. Every historian has condemned his execution. His failures, says one writer, proceeded from his virtues.",

Marshall and speeches by Mary White Ovington, chairman, N. A. A. C. P. board of directors, and Dr. W. E. Burghardt DuBois, editor The Crisis. Promptly at 8 o'clock, the half-hour musical program, that preceded all the evening sessions, was rendered by the Maxwell Quartette, and at 8:30 the meeting was opened. Miss Ovington spoke on 'Twenty Years of the N. A. A. C. P.' telling of the struggles of the association to get started. William English Walling, Dr. Chas. F. Thwing, president emeritus, Western Reserve University, John R. Shillady, Villard, ‘Charles  Russell, Henry Moscowitz are some of the names she mentioned as being identified with the work in its early stages. According to Miss Ovington, the first case that the association  handled was the ease of Pink  Franklin of South Carolina. A case of peonage. In 1911, the fight against lynching was started. It was a difficult task to arouse the white people, against the evil of lynching in those days, most of them thinking  that rape was the cause of all lynchings. It was also hard to get Negroes interested in the cause; but in 1919 when the migration of the Negro to northern cities started, the Negro became more interested in the work of the association and since that time the work has been more and more under the leadership of Negroes. James Weldon Johnson, she said, was the first colored secretary of the association. Pickens and DuBois were selected to carry on the work and since that time the interest of people all over the country, especially of the Negro, has been greater. She closed her speech with a challenge: 'Up to this time most of the support of the N. A. A. C. P, has come from white people; but the time has come when the Negro must support his own organization. Are you going to do it? There is no Negro in these United States who has not the same rights of citizenship as the white man.' DuBois Speaks 'Dr. W. E. B. DpBois followed Miss Ovington with an address on 'What the N. A. A, C,. P. Has Meant in American Life.' He spoke of the effect of the association on the American mind, telling of the struggle to change the mind and attitude of the people toward the Negro and his rights. Thursday, June 27 Thursday evening the conference was held at Shiloh Baptist Church, E. 55th street and Scovill avenue. Arthur Spingarn presided. Miss Nannie H. Burroughs, president of the National Training School for Women and Girls, Washington, D. C., was. the principal speaker. Her subject was 'America-A Democracy  With a Millstone About her Neck.' 'Race prejudice is the millstone about the neck of American democracy. There is more race prejudice in America than there is practical Christianity. The race problem is not the problem of the Negro: but the problem of the American people' The American people, Miss Burroughs said, put color before character. The two most distressing things in America today, according to Miss Burroughs, are: 1. 'To see white people satisfied with simply being white', and 2, 'To see the millions of, Negroes who are satisfied and sightless' She cited cases of prejudice as she has observed them in the South and told of some of the horrors of Jim Crowism and segregation. Prejudice an Economic Problem- Johnson Miss Burroughs was followed by Charles S. Johnson. director, department social service, Fisk University, who spoke on 'The Economic Foundation of Race Prejudice.' 'Race prejudice.' said Mr, Johnson, 'is class prejudice, Economics play a big part in the racial situation.' He attempted to show that racial prejudice is not instinctive, but is based on economic conditions. He spoke of the antipathy of the slave holders for the poor whites during slavery days and told of the reaction of the whites toward tho Chinese and Japanese when they threatened the economic security of the whites. Edwin R. Embree, president of the Julius Rosenwald Fund, gave a brief talk on 'Citizens of a Common Country.' He said in part, if the Negro wants to be recognized as an equal of the white man he must not ask for special privileges because of his race. Pickens Makes Speech Friday evening Mrs, Sallle W. Steward, president of the National Association of Colored Women, spoke on 'Negro Womanhood,' and William Pickens, field secretary of the N. A. A. C. P., made a characteristic speech, citing instances of prejudice in the southern states. Guests of Art Museum Saturday morning the conference was the guests of the Cleveland Museum of Art. Rossiter Howard, assistant director of the museum, presided. Jr. Howard made an address of welcome. Dr. DuBois spoke on 'Negro and Art.'  Loula Vaughn Jones, internationally known  violinist of Cleveland, rendered three numbers, and James Weldon Johnson read from his book, 'God's Trombones.' Mordecal Johnson addresses Group Sunday afternoon the public auditorium was filled to its capacity to hear Mordecal Johnson, president of Howard University and 1929 winner of the Spingarn medal, speak. Mr. Johnson held his audience spellbound and applause could be heard long after he had taken his seat. The other speaker was Congressman Hamilton Fish Jr. Monday evening the conference met at St. John A. M. E. church, East 40th and Central avenue, Dr. George W. Lucas, New Orleans, presiding. 'The Race Problem in the Children's Court' was the subject of an address by Eleanor Rowland Wembridge, referee of Juvenile Court of Cuyahoga county, Cleveland. Oscar DePriest. member of Congress, also made a speech on 'The Constitution and Our Rights' The closing meeting was held on Tuesday evening at the music hall, Pubic Auditorium. Harris E. Davis presiding. The Gillpin Players of Cleveland, Rowena Jellife, director, presented 'The No 'Count Boy,' by Paul Green, before the enthusiastic final conference started. Miss Mary White Ovington made the introductory remarks, telling of the custom and reason of the award of the Spingarn medal. Dr. Charles F. Thwing. president emeritus, Western Reserve University, made an address and presented the medal to Dr. Mordecal Wyatt Johnson amidst the thunderous applause of the audiences. Dr. Johnmon. recipient of the fifteenth medal award, responded in appropriate words and then Col. J. E. Spingarn held the customary 'three minutes greeting.' The meeting closed with the benediction by Rev. Thomas E. McKenny.",

JUNALUSKA, Sept. 26. —America has led the world in a practical demonstration that the Negro is educable; but has lagged behind England in giving to the Negro justice in courts of law and in developing his economic future, according to Dr W. W. Alexander, director of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation of Atlanta, speaking to the school of missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, in session here. To a southerner of Virginia, Dr. James H. Dillard, according to Dr. Pinca must go the credit for introducing into the British possessions in Africa an educational system based on the work done in -America. Dr. Dillard, as head of the Jeanes Slater board, a philanthropic foundation, devoted to the promotion of Negro education in the South, was a member of the commission sent to Africa to develop an educational system for primitive peoples and laid out a system based on what has been done in the South. While America has showed statesmanship in the field of Negro education, Dr. Alexander declared her standing was not so good in other fields, and cited as examples lynchings, failure of juries to convict white men of crimes against Negro women, and attempted passage of laws in some states prohibiting Negro barber shops from serving white customers, making it illegal for Negroes to work on construction jobs except in Negro communities and otherwise defining what jobs Negroes may work at. The speaker deplored the use of the race question to inflame public opinion. Both political parties did it. he said. and sometimes even in ecclesiastical controversies the Negro is made an issue when he does not belong in the question at all. North Carolina was praised by Dr. Alexander for the progress it has made in education. During the past year North Carolina spent twice as much on Negro education as on both white an Negro education 25 years ago.",

    cardDetailedText: "Chairman Johnson of the House of Representatives Immigration Committee advocates the halving of all immigration quotas from Europe while that from Mexico would be limited to half the number of its nationals that entered this country during the year ended April 30th. Negroes should get behind Johnson's resolution. Every Negro working man and woman should immediately sit down and pen a strong letter to the committee and to the congressman representing his district urging the immediate passage of the resolution. The Negro worker is suffering, and will suffer more from the contrived influx of Mexican labor. These aliens with a lower standard of living than Negro workers are increasingly invading the Southwest and the Mississippi Valleys and taking bread and butter from the mouths of colored people. In numerous localities where Negroes once had something of a monopoly of certain forms of labor, they are losing out to the Mexican. Conditions being what they are industrially in the United States, we cannot much longer stand this competition and keep up our rate of economic advance. We have nothing against the Mexican worker. He has a right to make a living just like. other people but he should be forced to exercise that right below the Rio Grande where there is plenty of land awaiting development. This country already has too many unemployed, workers competing with each other for the right to work without bringing in more. Write to your congressman demanding that he support this Johnson resolution. A few thousand such letters received by the nation's lawmakers will undoubtedly force them to give this important matter consideration. If we do not look our for our interests, who will? PICKETING WOOLWORT'S In Chicago. militant Negroes have carried the battle for jobs a step farther by picketing Woolworth five-and-ten cent store which refuses to hire Negro clerks though located in a Negro district. Signs bearing the legend 'This Store Unfair to Colored Labor—Do Not Spend Your Money Where You Cannot Work!' were carried up and down all day long in front of the store by determined black pickets. As a result the store's receipts dropped from several hundred dollars to only $8.75. This is a drastic move but we believe the unemployment condition among Negroes warrants it. The fact that the Negroes of Chicago responded so readily to the appeal of the pickets shows that our people are thinking as never before about their economic status. White merchants who own and operate stores in Negro districts and eagerly solicit Negro trade must be taught that they cannot carry money out of the section after business hours are over and not give Negro labor a single dime. If these merchants will not give our young men and women coming out of schools an opportunity to make a living at other than domestic or menial work, then it is our duty to refuse to give them our patronage. Remember the slogan and abide by it: DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY WHERE YOU CANNOT WORK.",

    cardDetailedText: "NEW YORK, Nov. 6—As I glanced over the fascinating pages of James Weldon Johnson's 'Black Manhattan,' touching every phase of Manhattan's Negro life, except the political and the religious, giving an appraisement of the Garvey Movement, such as Dr. DuBois with all of his brilliant analysis never did, I thought of the impression which Black Manhattan, and Harlem especially, has produced upon the world at large. For the past 15 years Harlem has been the storm center of Negro racialism. Negro political radicalism, Negro religious liberalism and the center of the Negro's literary, dramatic and musical renaissance. First came the Negro Society for Historical Research, which John E. Bruce and A, A. Schomburg founded. Then came the N. A. A. C. P. with its program of civic-and political equality, then the Urban League with its economic and social program. Then came the development of the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. all fine organizations, establishing their central headquarters in New York City. Then 13 years age, the Messenger, championing socialism and religious liberalism, and the Voice, edited by the late Hubert H. Harrison, made their bows to the reading public. Then 12 years ago the Negro World started its crusade of racialism and the redemption of Africa, and the U. N. I. A. began to spread over the world like a tidal wave, are using the racial consciousness of black men and women everywhere and commanding the attention of the civilized world. While colored men had served as assistant district attorney and assistant corporation counsel and had gone to the state legislature and aldermanic council in Harlem, this was not regarded as a Harlem innovation, as they were doing the same thing in Chicago simultaneously and had done the same thing in Boston a generation ago. Dr. Willlam Howard Day ard Rev. Dr. Mallon Van Horre had even served on the Board of Education of Harrisburg, Pa. and Newport. R. I., forty years ago. When I came ta New York City in August, 1919, to edit the Negro World, Harlem was rightly regarded by the country as the whirling dynamo of Negro political and racial activity, In a three-column article on Negro radicalism, which began on the front page of the Chicago Tribune in the late spring of 1920, it was Harlem first, last and everywhere. And then things began to happen in the musicale, dramatic and literary world. 'Billboard' Jackson began to write about Negro singers, dancers and actors, W. C. Handy, the father of the blues, began to gain recognition as a musical genius. Then Whitney & Tutt, Miller & Lyles and Sissle & Blake came along. 'Shuffle Along' and other musical comedies made a hit. Then came Charles Gilpin. starring in 'Emperor Jones,' and Florence Mills, starring in 'Black Birds,' getting on Broadway. Then followed 'Porgy,' 'Lulu Belle,' 'Hallelujah' and now 'The Green Pastures,' starring Richard Harrison and Salem Whitney, is sweeping Broadway. Meanwhile, Dr. DuBois, Willlam Pickens and James Weldon Johnson were breaking into print again. Walter White and Jesse Fauset were turning out novels, Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes were singing songs and Paul Robeson was appearing in 'Othello' Sao we may safely say that more Negro editors and authors, composers, singers, dramatists and actors of note and distinction may be found in Harlem than in all of the country put together. Early Literary Activity What is the cause? A luxuriant growth of vegetation never springs from a barren soil. Thirty-five years ago, lower New York, between 17th and 53d streets, was the center of Negro literary activity. Twenty-five years ago it was the center of Negro musical activity, but the country was so swept off of its feet by the fad of industrial education that it paid little attention to the colored brother's cultural aspiration. Noted colored scholars addressed the St. Mark's Lyceum, New York City, and the Brooklyn Literary and Concord Literary in Brooklyn. In those days Mrs. Victoria Earl Mathews had a literary cult, and entertained at her home Dr. Alexander Crummeil, Dr. Edward Wilmot Biyden, T. Thomas Fortune and Alice Ruth Moore, In the summer of 1908 I heard the assistant corporation counsel, James D. Carr, deliver an address upon 'Evolution' at the philosophical club of Mrs. A. C. Cowan in Brooklyn. The Negro almost made it in those days. When I was a student at Yale and Shaw's octarooms played in a large white opera house in New Haven, Conn., the singing of Belle Davis and Mattie Wilkes made a hit. Then, after I had graduated from college, I saw Willlams and Walkers 'Sons of Ham' make a hit in a white opera house in Philadelphia. Then their: 'Bandanna Land' and their 'Abyssinia' played for a season at a New York opera house. I recall that in the summer of 1908 E. H. Clement, the editor of the Boston Transcript, wrote me that he had seen Ernest Hogan, the Negro comedian, and that he believed that the Negro possessed innate dramatic and musical gifts. The now —-- Negro 35 years ago was struggling to give literary expression and 25 years ago to give dramatic and musical expression to his hopes, longings, aspirations and ideals, and white people were inclined to encourage them. I recall reading, when I was a schoolboy, that Chauncey M. Depew and Robert Ingersoll spoke at a mass meeting in Cooper Union in honor of Frederick Douglass. Later I read about Chauncey M. Depew, Robert Ingersoll and Col. 'Teddy' Roosevelt speaking in Bethel A. M. E. Church, when Dr J. H. Henderson was pastor. It was at a meeting In the same church that one of these men saw in Charles W. Anderson a coming orator. When a colored student at Tale, Harvard. Dartmouth, Brown, Amberst, Wilhams, Cornell, Columbia, Ann Arbor and the University of Pennsylvania manifested unusual intellectual ability he was pushed to the front, Everywhere, from Boston to Washington, Negro talent was recognized. The Decline But then in 1895 came the fad for industrial education and the Negros self-effacement from politics, which was sponsored by a prominent Negro educator. From 1895 to 1920 the trend of Caucasian propaganda was to dampen the Negros literary and political aspirations. And colored men fell for the bait, saying, 'Ditto, Lord.' Colored Republican leaders like Hon. Charles W. Anderson and Hon. Fred R. Moore would say 'the time is not ripe when talented colored men desired political advancement.' I recall vividly conversations with national Republican leaders, Massachusetts state leaders, Connecticut state leaders and New York state leaders when I would refer to their seeming indifference to the colored brother. Then even some of the so-called radical leaders regarded William Monroe Trotter as too radical. I know of no more perfect example of what is called 'the inferiority complex' than what most of they colored leaders manifested between! 1895 and 1915 and what a few manifest today. It is to the undying glory of some Negroes who were born in New York City or who migrated to Harlem that they cried continually, 'Give us a place in the sun' until the world listened to them. If the poorly trained and thoughtless Negro opportunists had not fallen asleep and been doped with the inferiority complex, they would have received twenty years ago the political, literary, dramatic and musical recognition which they are beginning to receive today. What of the future? If the new Negro can take a middle ground between the defiant braggadocio and, bravado of Marcus Garvey and 'the inferiority complex' which Negro leaders everywhere manifested between 1895 and 1915 and which a few leaders manifest today, Black Harlem and colored America will rise north of the Mason and Dixon line to still higher heights of eminence in the political, educational, literary, dramatic and musical reals. Some may wonder why I have ommitted the Cosmopolitan Club in which Miss Mary White Ovington, Professor Tridon, William Humphrey and Hon. John E. Milholland were prominent figures, which staged a much discussed banquet in the spring of 1903. That was not a Negro movement, but an effort on the part of liberal white thinkers to encourage budding Negro genius.",

All members of his immediate family were at his bedside when death came peacefully to the 69-year- old financier. whose rise to the head of Sears, Roebuck & Co. is another epoch of American business success and whose widespread philanthropy brought him honor the country over. His benefactions in many fields of welfare amount to more than $15,000,000. He established the employers’ savings and pension fund for the benefit of his thousands of workers in 1916. He erected a $3,000,000 industrial museum in Chicago. He gave $6,000,000 to aid Jewish colonization upon Russian farms. He donated $3,000,000 to the University of Chicago. But his greatest pleasure was in the Julius Rosenwald Foundation, for which he set aside $35,000,000 for the 'well-being of mankind.’ Real Friend To Negro Mr Rosenwald's philanthropy aided the Negro immeasurably. Realizing the Negro's need of help. Rosenwald became interested in this cause in 1910 He aided in the erection of 16 Y. M. C. A. buildings and two Y. W. C. A. buildings for colored people. Later he erected a model apartment house for Negroes. The status of Negro education in 13 states was appreciably elevated through his help in erecting more than 4,000 'Julius Rosenwald schools.'

President Hoover regretted that Chicago and the Nation had lost an 'outstanding citizen.'

His patriotism was reflected both in his services in the cause of national defense during the war and in his devotion to the upbuilding of the life of the community and the country: in times of peace.

The contention set forth by the petitioners was that there had been 576 lynchings in Mississippi and that Miner could not get a fair trial there. RESULT OF NEGRO MIGRATION SHOWN IN POPULATION FIGURES ATLANTA, Ga, May 26.—(CNS) —Mr. R. B. Eleazer, educational director of the commission on Interracial cooperation of Atlanta has recently made a study of the populations of the South, and states in a report just Issued that Negroes in the South are not is numerous in proportion to the whites as they were in 1820. He said that in ten years the net increases of whites in the thirteen southern states was 3,115,400 or 14.8 per cent, while the increase in the Negro population was only 364,529, or 4.3 per cent, This statement Is significant, but taken alone would indicate a decrease in the Negro population of the entire country. This erroneous impression Is dispelled when it Is noted that the Negroes of the New England States increased 19.0 per cent; the Middle Atlantic, 75.4 per cent; the East North Central, 80.8 per cent; the West North Central, 19.1 per cent; the West South Central, 10.8 per cent, and the Pacific States 88.6 per cent. The total Negro population of continental United States was 11,891,143 in 1830, a against 10,463,131 in 1920—an increase of 13.8 per cant. The white population of the country increased only 14.8 per cent, having the advantage of proportionately more immigration than the Negro population. Ten years of mounting taxation has brought the country on the rocks. Washington seems to think ten years more of the same program will return prosperity.",

    cardTitle: "Columbia Professor Strikes A New Note In Negro Education",
    cardSubtitle: "Educator Says Pictures of Negroes Who Have Achieved Success Should Be Displayed In Classrooms of Colored Educational Institutions",
    cardDetailedText: "WASHINGTON, Dec. 22-—A professor of Teachers College of Columbia University, addressing the Associated Publishers at 1538 Ninth Street, Northwest, Washington, D. C., sounds a new note in the education of the Negro. It may be fortunate that it comes from a white institution, for the 'mis educated Negro' may now heed this advice which we have been giving for many years. A This professor says, 'I should like very much to list in a pamphlet on research sources, the addresses of publishing houses from which good pictures of prominent Negroes can be obtained. I have always been a great believer in a school’s putting up before its pupils the pictures of men and women who have made notable achievements. I have been unable by myself, however, to locate the addresses of such publishing houses from which schools could secure such pictures,' The Associated Publishers took occasion to remind. the professor that for a number of years it has been supplying pictures of all prominent and ‘useful Negroes, ranging from the very smallest to 1ife size pictures suitable for display in assembly balls. While the effort has been given adequate publicity our teachers have not thought of this unusual opportunity. They have probably been waiting for some one else to approve the plan. Now they have the necessary endorsement. Commenting on the educational value of such service this professor says, 'In my judgment, in issuing these pictures you are doing a splendid work A picture of a man or woman who ha achieved something worthwhile is a distinct asset in a school room, particularly if the Individual represents a practical end attainable ideal for the pupil. When I was Professor of School Administration in the George Peabody College for Teachers nearly 20 years ago, I used to go out each year for a week or so to visit Negro schools. 'On these visits,I was struck with the fact that about the only pictures of persons in the schools were the conventional ones of Lincoln and Washington, or the artiste calendars gotten out by advertising companies. In very rare instances I saw an old, dilapidated picture of Frederick Douglass or Booker T. Washington. I took the matter up vigorously with various people at the time, but could find no such offering as you now make available, Accordingly. I wish you every success in this work.' This professor might have added that in some of these schools you find no pictures at ail but those of the sort advertising chewing tobacco, showing how Doc Sutera 'Old Reliable Bitters' has stimulated weak men, and what Lydia Pinkham's Vegetable Compound has done for the relief of women it can hardly be believed that such as these are placed on the walls to inspire the pupils. They indicate rather a lack of an aesthetic ideal and the failure to make use of visualization In education. When sold now for low prices ranging between two cents and a dollar almost any school may place on its walls the pictures of distinguished Negroes. The higher institutions, moreover, may do more than decorate rooms with ordinary pictures. With the large number of rising artists in the race like Aaron Douglass, J. L. Wells and Lois M. Jones, it 1s possible to place in our schools the paintings of the outstanding Negroes for whom these buildings are named. Why do we name our buildings for Dunbar, Douglass and Washington and then do not show enough interest to Rang before the student body paintings of these world characters? It ta unfortunate that we find teachers themselves utterly unconcerned about such an important aspect of our education. You often see in buildings named for Crispus Attucks. Benjamin Bannaker, Phillis Wheatley or Daniel A. Payne teachers who do not know anything about these characters or why these buildings are thus designated. These employees are there not to teach, but to make a living easily. Their bosses are not Interested in the Negro. Why should they be? Pastors of churches, too. are equally as ignorant of the founders of these institutions. A church recently celebrating its anniversary. instead of having its own story to give to the world. had to write us for a each and a picture of its founder. Pastors there have come and gone, but they were not interested In the written record. They were seeking collections to pay off mortgages and to buy gewgaws and toys. In this way we have lost ground and have tended to become a negligible factor in the thought of the world. Thus it happens with people when they forget what they have thought and felt and attempted and accomplished. This failure to appreciate the men who have made the past and the consequent emphasis upon trifles of the present resulted from the terrible blow which slavery dealt us. That nefarious system severed our connection with the glorious past of the race and left us unable to evaluate the great factors which in their cumulative effect with the years have made life worth while. We no longer think of our race as having great traditions; and, being unable to look back far into the past we cannot look far into the future. People who come from nowhere may not get any where. From one of the philosophers, however, we may learn 'what an enormous camera-obscura’ magnifier is tradition! How a thing grows in the human memory, in the human imagination, when love, worship, and all that lies in the human heart is there to encourage it and in the darkness In the entire ignorance, without date or document. no book. no Arundel marble, only here and there some dull monumental cairn!' We must go back to the achievements of these black men, then, and. looking into these black faces of heroes and heroines, get inspiration to achieve as well as they did. With a vision of these great souls looking down upon. us and urging us on to complete the unfinished task to the performance of which they made an outstanding contribution, let us press forward to the next objective in the development and uplift of the despised and rejected of men.",

    cardDetailedText: "CHICAGO, July 6—A new radicalism among American Negroes stimulated by the migration northward from the south, the World war, and the depression, is spreading steadily, it was declared tonight by Rayford W. Logan, Washington, D. C. in an address before the 2th annual conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People here at The Olivet Barptist Church, 31st street and South Parkway. Mr. Logan, who is assistant director of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, traced the growth of liberal and radical thought among Negroes from the early slave rebels such as Nat Turner and Deumark Vessy, which led uprisings against their masters, to Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, editor of The Crisis magazine. DuBois said. the speaker. 'in biting, poignant and sometimes bitter, but always unanswerable logic, revealed the crass, petty, brutal inequalities from which Negro suffered.' Negroes who came north in great numbers are vocal in  denunciation of inequalities and prejudice as soon as they realized the great difference between 'the promised land' north of the Mason and Dixon line and the conditions in the south, the speaker said, and even though prejudice was increased in the north because of the influx, there was compensation in the awakening of great masses of Negroes to their problems and the possibilities of solution. The World war resulted in making the Negro ripe for radicalism because of the treatment of the Negro troops and the advice given them to 'behave themselves' and 'act like they were in Mississippi' Logan said. 'The Communists' said the speaker 'taking advantage of the trying times during the past four years, have redoubled their efforts to win converts to their cause. How many Negroes they have won is difficult to estimate. If one live in the shadow of Washington park in Chicago or Union square in New York, one is likely to conclude that 'Der Tag' is just around the corner. If, however the observer moves about in other parts of the country, he is forced to conclude that Communism has not gained any real hold on most Negroes.' Miss Sarah Alice Mayfield of Birmingham Ala, a graduate of Birmingham Southern College, who is pursuing graduate study at the University of Chicago, declared white students in the south were becoming more liberal on the race question. She said white southern students today were seeking actual information about Negroes for themselves and were no longer content to accept that handed them by their parents and others who have the traditional attitudes and prejudices. John Gray, leader of a Negro youth movement in Chicago, also spoke.",

C, August 10- John Prescott Davis, executive secretary of the Negro Industrial League continued the determined fight for low-waged workers when he appeared before the National Recovery Administration's hearings on the steel industry, held last Monday, before nearly 1,000 white persons, in the main auditorium of the Department of Commerce building. Deputy Administrator K. I. Simpson presided over the afternoon hearings where both Mr. Davis and Dr. Robery Weaver appeared. After identifying himself as a representative of the Negro Industrial League. Mr. Davis began his --- of facts which went in the bottom of the labor and wage injustices, particularly in the south. Arguments Meet Objection To realize the necessity in such --- hearing as this.' began Mr Davis 'of confining ourselves to statements of factual information having direct hearing upon this code and upon the specific articles under discussion.' ---- 61.984 colored laborers. This unit represents 15 per cent of the total number of persons under the classification of laborers, In the high branches of the steel and iron industry the Negro totals 29.685 workers. Two important regions of the industry are in a group of states including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, and in the Southern section made up of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee, The Davis statement farther showed that in the West 30,034 colored workers, classified as laborers, are in the steel and iron mills. In the South there are 19,293 colored laborers., Of the total 31,234 laborers the Negro represents 60 per cent of the total for the Southern states. Alabama has 10,515 colored laborers in the Iron and steel industry. These workers constitute 81 per cent of the total laborers employed by the branches of the industry in the State covered by the proposed code. Rent Only Higher In Pittsburgh Charging that 'the purpose of division of the steel industry into wage districts is to perpetuate wage differentials,' Mr. Davis continued, 'much has been said. of the difference in cost of living in the South and the rest of the country. The degree of differences has been over stated. In the case of the cost of living in Birmingham (Ala), the most important center of the iron and steel industry in the South and in Pittsburgh, a corresponding center of the West, price quotations for certain leading foodstuffs, etc. are available for as recent a date as June 15 19--.' In the for item detail, the speaker compared the cost of most of the basic foodstuffs in Pittsburgh with Birmingham, Concluding this portion of his statement, Mr. Davis said, 'on the basis of such an analysis from Bulletin 357, Bureau of Labor Statistics) and from the total prices presented above, it appears that there is no reason to expect the food and light and fuel groups of good, which represents the greater part of the expenditure for wage earning families to warrant the presumption of a marked difference in the cost of living between the leading cities of the Southern and Western branches of the iron and steel industry.... With the exception of rent, there are no important components in this remainder of goods and services whose price is appreciably greater in the Western city (Pittsburgh). In so far as the differential in the cost of housing for the Southern worker is due to the existence of the employer-owned house. it is an objectionable feature and should be corrected. In no circumstances should it be the basis for lower wage raises in the South. in so far as the differential is due to unsatisfactory and overcrowded dwellings in the South, it should certainly not be the purpose of this, code to perpetuate these conditions. Holding that the second reason for the difference between wages in the South and wages paid in the West is due to “'the rather, ambiguous general economic condition in Article III. Section 3 of the code.' Mr. Davis said. 'at present there are vast reservoirs of potential workers congregated about each and every center of this all other industries ... The existence of a large potential labor supply in the South is not a characteristic peculiar to that section and offers no basis for a difference in the rate of minimum wage raise.' Praises Labor Secretary Perkins Mr. Davis concluded his statement by saying ‘There exist no reason for a difference between the wages paid in the Southern States and the wages paid in other sections. Our appearance here would not have been necessary had there been an inkling of the splendid speech of Secretary Perkins made at the ‘beginning of this hearing. We can do no more in a discussion of wages and hours than to concur in her recommendations that the, multiplicity of districts be abolished in this code, the hours be reduced, that wages be increased to no less than 43 cents an hour for the Southern district.' Mr. John Prescott Davis, who has appeared at hearings on all of the codes for all large industries of the nation, received his education Bates College, Lewiston, Maine. He received his LLB. from Harvard School of Law this year. His co-worker, Dr. Robert Weaver, is the youngest student to ever secure a Ph.D. from Harvard University, Dr. Weaver, who holds two other degrees In economics from Harvard, Is research director or the Negro Industrial League.

    cardDetailedText: "NEW YORK, Oct. 11—The unprecedented nation-wide interest shown among racial leaders of every walk of life in the plans of the National Urban League for organizing Negro labor under the set-up of Negro Workers’ Councils has resulted fa expanding the organized Committee of One Hundred to a larger group of five hundred members. The league's headquarters at 1133 Broadway, in New York City, reported this week that the Committees of One Hundred for Negro Workers has been more than filled and, consequently, the national chairman, Robert S. Abbott, publisher of the Chicago Defender, has decided on the increase. One hundred and five Negro men and women, including some of the mast important names in the country, have already paid fees of five dollars or more in accepting committee membership. Mr. Abbott states that probably never before had so large a committee requiring so considerable a membership, fee been completed so quickly on a nation-wide scale. In a letter sent out this week to the original Committee of One Hundred he makes the following statement: I am go, pleased with the success that crowned efforts to secure 100 prominent Negro men and women to provide the moral and financial background for the campaign of the National Urban League on behalf of Negro workers throughout the country, and so convinced of the importance of the task before us that I am forced to the idea that a further effort to enlarge this number to at least 500 should be made at once. 'To this end, I am suggesting that you, as a charter member of the committee, seek to interest at least five persons of your community in the worthwhileness of this project—five persons who will give at least $5 and thus become members of the enlarged committee.' The Committee of Five Hundred, when completed, will not attempt to assume direction of the Negro Workers’ Councils, the National Urban League assures. The members, Individually and as a group, will rally community and racial support behind the program of the councils and stimulate interest In their activities. 'It Is a significant thing that we are beginning to realize more and more the need for on Intelligent and aggressive leadership for Negro labor recruited directly from the workers themselves,' stated T. Arnold Hill, acting executive secretary of the National Urban League. 'This leadership has been lacking in the past, partly because or a dearth of interest among Negro workers themselves in the problems which affect all labor regardless of race, and partly because community leaders, Ignorant of labor's problems, have often confused the issues and given misleading advice though with the very best of motives. The Labor Institutes, which are an important feature of the council's program, will undoubtedly produce an increased class-consciousness on the part of Negro labor and stimulate leadership.",

    cardDetailedText: "SANDUSKY, O., Aug. 25—(ANP)—Inequalities of education for Negroes in separate schools and reasons why whites for their own benefit should give the colored race equal scholastic opportunities were told oy Dr. Floyd Reeves, white, chairman of President Roosevelt's Advisory Committee on Education, in an address Monday night before the national convention of the American Federation of Teachers. After describing how farm children in general had fewer opportunities than those in urban areas, Dr. Reeves declared: 'From the standpoint of inequality of educational opportunity, the most unfortunate situation that exists today is in connection with the education of Negroes. In all of those states maintaining separate school systems for Negroes, racial discrimination exists. The Negro schools as a group are only about half as well supported as the white schools. All the statistics for such items as length of school term, average attendance, educational qualifications of teachers, and type of school buildings demonstrate clearly that a wasteful neglect is characteristic of the treatment of Negro school children in most of the areas where they are required to attend separate schools. 'White taxpayers may ask, 'Why should we be taxed to supply Negro children with an educational opportunity equal to that of our own children? The answer is simple. Democracy requires equality of opportunity without racial discrimination. But there is a second reason that should not be overlooked. From a purely selfish standpoint, the whites cannot afford to be uninterested In the education of the Negro. 'Because of the intimate economic relations that necessarily exist between the two races, the low level of education among Negroes is a severe burden not only on themselves but on all who must employ them or have dealings with them. Even Northern states should be interested in the education of Southern Negroes, because the large influx of Negroes from the South makes the quality of their previous education a matter of vital importance to the communities where they reside and work.",

A release from the office of the Board President, Raymond B. Fosdick, this week, explained: 'The life of the General Education Board Is running to its close. It is probable that within a few years its fund will be completely exhausted and the organization will be liquidated. The Trustees have felt that in the rapidly moving times, through which we have lived since the war, it was more important to meet challenging opportunities in the development of fields like medical education for example, than it was to conserve principal funds for some indefinite future. 'There are no scales, of course, by which the potentialities of the present can be weighed against those of the future, But the present Is vividly here, with its needs and possibilities; the future is beyond reckoning and we of this generation must live in the faith that it will find means to provide for itself, This In brief is the point of view which has led the trustees to approach the coming liquidation of the General Education Board with the belief that it represent as far as limited human intelligence can foresee, a socially desirable step.' Reaction of colored leaders to the board's announcement were varied, but all agreed that with the board's closing the cause of Negro education will lose a valued and potent ally. A prominent Southern business man, connected in an official capacity with a Southern college, in New York on a business trip, declared: 'I am surprised to learn that the General Education Board, which has been one of the most important influences in the educational life of the Negro, is to leave the field. Stemmed in a conference hell in 1902 at Tuskegee Institute with Booker T. Washington, Dr. Wallace Buttrick, George Foster, William H. Baldwin and others present, the board as destined to serve not only the Negro, for whom it was to some extent formed, but national and international projects. 'Of the 255 million dollars spent by the board in 35 years, only 49 million dollars was spent for Negro educational facilities. “The General Education Board has done a grand job, but it is one which is far from being finished. What great force can take its place? How far can Negroes help? How far will they actually help? Have Negroes in Southern States been wakened enough so that they can unite, use their political strength, direct and indirect, and thus bring about greater equality in expenditures, equipment and curricula in the educational institutions of the South?' Established in 1902 by John Davison Rockefeller, the General Education Board was dedicated, In the words of Its charter, to 'the promotion of education within the United States without distinction of race, sex or creed.' While Mr. Rockefeller's gifts to the board, extending from 1802 to 1821, constituted practically the entire principal fund, smaller gifts came from Miss Anna T. Jeanes, the estate of Laura Spelman Rockefeller and the estate of Lucy M. Spelman, as well as from other miscellaneous sources. The total amount received by the board in gifts and the accrediting thereof, exclusive of income from investments, was $179,754,751.44. The total of $255,334,670.57 spent in the 35 years ending 1937, was divided by the board as follows: Medical education, $89,000,000; higher education (college of liberal arts) $68,000,000; Negro education, $40,000,000; special educational programs, $53,000,000.",

    cardSubtitle: "",
    cardDetailedText: "THE COMING NEGRO MIGRATION The economic barometer indicates an accelerated migration of Negroes from the South to the North. The cause of this accelerated migration will be the farther collapse of the cotton economy which all government efforts have failed to prevent. At one time the South dominated the cotton markets of the world and the section enjoyed a relative prosperity compared to many other agricultural regions of the world. The spread of extensive cotton culture to many other lands such as Brazil, Egypt, southern Russia, India, China and other sub-tropical regions has greatly Increased world cotton production while tending to lower the price. To counteract this trend toward cotton price decline there has been a wide-spread introduction of machinery into cotton culture and a gradual change in the status of cotton labor from sharecropping and tenantry to farm labor. It was believed by some that the European war would boost the world price of cotton and thus return a measure of security and stability if not prosperity to those Southern regions dependent upon cotton. This hope has not been realized because of the sharp decline of the British pound sterling to $3.75 instead of the old rate of $4.86, thanks to the tremendous expenditures incident to military and naval activities. Since Britain and France must pay cash for whatever they buy in the American market, and since the exchange is them, they have been restricting their purchases to implements of warfare and essential commodities only obtainable in the American. Instead of increasing purchases of cotton, they have been decreasing them, and last week cotton prices In Liverpool dropped to the lowest limit. This low price cannot help but hurt the American cotton grower whose standard of living is pitched on a higher plane than that of any other in the world today. In seeking for other means of maintaining the economic standards of life, the South has been encouraging by every means the industrialization of the region, making attractive offers to manufacturers to establish more mills and factories in the region. The new Southern industries are employing only a small number of the Negro workers displaced by the change in the status of cotton, and in many factories no Negroes at all are employed. This, coupled with the inadequate relief payments to unemployed Negro workers, is the cause of the growing migration of these peoples to the North and Fast. They are coming to the cities where already from 40 cent to 50 per cent of the Negro population Is receiving relief and unable to get employment They will increasingly compete with Negroes already in the cities for the number of jobs available to colored people, and this competition will tend to further lower wages, especially in unskilled and domestic work in which the bulk of urban Negro workers are engaged. The whole picture is extremely gloomy and a sharp challenge to leadership regardless of race. In the coming political campaign Negroes will do well to carefully scrutinize the platforms and personalities of the various parties to see how they intend to handle this increasingly serious problem. It is clear that any curtailment of relief payments, as advocated by some politicians will be fatal to the Negro population. It is equally clear that some intelligent national policy is needed to halt or lessen this migration by improving economic conditions in the South. Any political party or candidate that ignores this serious problem or tries to deal with it by issuing platitudinous planks signifying nothing fundamental does not merit and should not receive the support of Negro voters.",

Just as truly as the French workers saw the social gains which they had achieved through Leon Blum, melt away under the impact of the war and the reactionary government of Daladier, so to an extent are the American workers facing the possibility of a victory of the super-patriotic National Manufacturers association who would outlaw strikes and preserve the status quo in bargaining relations, thus blocking any further drive to organize the unorganized. In this Situation it is regrettable that Negro workers cannot always join with other workers to support those organizations and programs that would offer aggressive militant leadership for the preservation of the rights of labor which have already been gained, the extension of the benefits of collective bargaining to the unskilled masses, while at the same time cooperating with the government in a program of national defense. But black workers have found through years of bitter experience, that they are black as well as workers. While sharing In the general problems of all labor, they have a peculiar set of difficulties arising out of their racial identity, which, as James Weldon Johnson has said,' . . makes it necessary for the Negro to look at the world through the prism of being a black man. In the two problems which face the labor movement today . . the struggle for leadership and a program within the CIO and the question of labor unity between the CIO and the A. F. of L. — the Negro must act always in terms of what will be best for him as a Negro, and then what will be best, for the labor movement and the, country. The Negro Worker, like the Negro citizen, cannot assume the role of a 'lily white angel' making self-sacrifices for a principle which allows him nothing but unemployment and starvation. A review of the kaleidoscopic shift; of events which have changed the. entire complexion of the labor, movement within the past two months will illustrate the fact that all labor is facing a crisis and show, he special difficulties of the Negro worker in attempting to orient himself in this confused world. LEWIS BREACH PAVES WAY FOR HILLMAN It all happened sometime ago, according to the people in ‘the 'know.' when William Green and John L. Lewin wars called in by the President and shown the ‘M-Day Plans” (mobilization day) for labor. It is rumored that Greene agreed to go along with the administration, while Lewis objected strenuously. This disagreement with the President furthered the split which had already developed between them and paved the way for the appointment of Sidney Hillman, a gentleman of much more amenable character, as labor chief of the National Defense Advisory commission. ‘PINCER MOVEMENT' CATCHES LEWIS With the skillful maneuvering of the Administration and the enormous prestige of the President on one side and on the other the ideological and personal differences which Lewis had with some of the leaders of CIO unions, Lewis found himself at the time of the convention the victim of a 'pincer movement,' which had Isolated him and his extreme left wing followers from the bulk of the CIO members in spite of his great personal popularity. Since then, Lewis has drifted further to the ‘left' (or 'right' according to your own political orientation) and recently P. M., New York's new and energetic dally, released the fact that Daughter Kathryn, John L.'s trusted adviser and confidante had joined such Hitler appeasers as Henry, Ford, Robert E. Woods, Hugh Johnson, Alice Roosevelt Longworth and Eddie Rickenbacher. One could predict that there will be a continued movement to the 'right' of what remains of the once militant CIO until the 'shot gun wedding' between it and the bureaucratic A. F. of L. is affected. LIBERALS WASTE FEW TEARS ON JOHN L. Most leberals throughout the country, have wasted few tears on John L. Lewis and feel that his argument with the President was personal and vindictive and that he is what he characterized Garrer as being 'A mean whiskey drinking old man.' We, however, cannot dismiss Lewis in such terms either from the point of view of one Interested in the welfare of the general labor movement or as one interested In that special segment of labor which is black. The fact that Lewis was the dynamic driving force behind the whole CIO movement to organize the unorganized workers in the mass production Industries need not be labored. ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS NEGRO CHAMPION Of more special interest is his attitude toward Negro workers. As president of the United Mine Workers’ union, Lewis has had, for years, more Negro members than any other labor group in the country, and is willing to cope with the problems incident to the integration of Negroes into labor organization. During the five years which the CIO has been in existence, Lewis definitely has established himself as the champion of not only the Negros rights to join labor unions, but has waged an aggressive fight for political freedom for the Negro in the South. Whatever Lewis’ faults may be, whatever bad judgment he may have had on other questions: however erratic his behavior may have appeared to politicians, he has done more than any living man to advance the cause of the Negro in labor. MURRAY WILL BE. FAIR, BUT WILL LACK ZEAL What course Philip Murray, the new CIO chief, will take and to what extent Lewis will continue to exercise influence on the program of the organization will be determined by time. But in this instance the shifting of leadership of the CIO has robbed the Negro worker of his one great champion. Murray may attempt to 'play fair' with Negroes but he can never be the aggressive crumbing champion of the black worker that Lewis was. What is best for the general labor movement, at this particular period, we are not in a position to say, but viewing the situation through the prism of color one can only arrive at the conclusion that the first step toward labor unity has resulted in a loss for the Negro.",

    cardDetailedText: "WASHINGTON, Aug. 23—Do the Negroes employed in the building service Industry need a powerful, unified organization with a sincere leadership to unite them in their political, and economic struggles for higher wages and shorter hours? A glance at the conditions prevailing gives a mighty, affirmative answer. Scores Are Underpaid Fourteen hours a day and a day off only 'when my owner gives it to me,' is the situation of one bitter Negro elevator operator, duplicated everywhere over the entire country. There is a bit of sardonic humor in his answer; he Means of course the owner of the building. A sum of $50 a month for 98 weekly hours represents this man's total earning capacity, although he has reached the age of forty. Many janitors are working only for their rent in basement quarters (which probably violate all the laws on housing!) and are expected to be on the premises 24 hours; these hours make it Impossible for them to supplement their meager wages, where they do get any. One cannot help marveling at the patience of these people who permit themselves 30 long to live under conditions where they must have two jobs in order to provide themselves with bread. One job should be enough to. provide everyone with more than the necessities of life! Given Menial Jobs Negroes suffer doubly. Not only are they constantly refused jobs because of color discrimination, but even where they have them, and have worked for five or ten years conscientiously, they are exposed to the mercy of the employer's whims and scruples about colored people. A report from a Brooklyn organizer on the Bush Terminal, a storage and renting enterprise, shows quite vividly what the trend in the building service industry is. He has had to testify before the NRA Board that this company. which employs both black and white help, fired a large part of its building service employes, and is now having an elevator operator sweep the streets, wash the windows, and scrub floors. In other words, according to his report. Bush Terminal is gong to show the world how to do away with porters, window cleaners and scrubwormen. Need for Organization Urgent With such objective conditions, the Building Service Employes Union has a tremendous base for organization; but a large membership will rapidly disintegrated unless proper tactics are adopted and the right leadership Is in the saddle. A recheck of the membership of the locals in the Borough of Manhattan gives evidence that there is an Important movement in the direction of this union; they have 7,000 members out of 350,000 employed In this industry. As was stated in this column last week, the Negro group, which by this time must be approximately 1,000, is distinguishing itself in its ability to recognize the fundamental principles of trade unionism and in its hungry desire for unity around a program to bring a better life. It is Important, therefore, that some of the weaknesses of this organization, which are found also in a large part of the American union movement, be exposed and speedily corrected so that they will not be handicapped from within when some decisive problems with employers arise. Some Unions Have Helped A Negro member has been the first to analyze for the writer the must outstanding weakness in the union, although the various locals have really been very effective instruments in counteracting discrimination against Negroes in search of jobs and in compelling owners of buildings to take back their workers fired because they were black, victories which warrant the existence of the organization as far ax the Negroes are concerned. He complains against the practice of splitting up the industry into separate unions corresponding to the division of work, as into porters, watchmen, elevator operators, and janitors. Asked for a reason for splitting up workers in this way, a union lender of New York replied: 'Well, you know how it is. The workers aren't ready to come together yet. The superintendents think they are better than the handymen and separating them keeps them from fighting.' This is not so in Tacoma, Wash,. Local 38 is listed as organizing all the divisions just named into one local; and in Harlem New York, where there is a Janitor in the same local with the porters 'under' him, a fine spirit of understanding has been achieved., This is the same old applesauce in a different pinte. You know what it is like: 'We can't have blacks and whites together. They just wont mix. And It will start a race riot.' Real Unity Needed Another serious failing which the Negroes, with their much more highly developed instinct for unity, must take the leadership in correcting, is that of having seven different autonomous locals in the same city without a central council to coordinate their activities until they unite Into one union. What an infantile outlook on labor organization! Within the Building Service Employes Union Negroes must see that two specific practices are begun in order to facilitate their work of organizing and to prepare them for winning improved conditions for both union and non-union service employes. They must get immediately plenty of space in the official magazine, 'Public Safety.' published at 130 North Wells street. Chicago, where they can have an open national forum for the discussion of the special problems which always arise in connection with the Negroes in this country. In addition to this demand. they must see also that the union provides them with educational opportunities in subjects pertinent lo their activities, so that they. can really become the leaders of their people in this Industry.",

    cardDetailedText: "HISPANIC FROM PAGE A-1 on sleeping pads on the floor,in an apartment provided by the restaurant owner. They call him el patron, a term that carries the connotation of a strong, paternal boss. 'An Anglo might not even notice them in a Chinese restaurant,' says Miguel Sague, leader of Guaracha, one of Pittsburgh's best known Latino bands, which provides the dancing music on this particular Saturday night. 'But they are here. In the city, and in the suburbs as well.' Although Pittsburgh's Latino population is small compared to communities, it is nonetheless growing. There were 9,700 Latinos in Allegheny County at the end of 1994, according to the most recent Census Bureau estimate available, up from 8,700 in 1980 — a 12 percent increase in just three years. Their population in the five-county metropolitan area of Pittsburgh was 16,000, and 300,000 in the state as a whole. This is still a small portion of the overall population - around 2 percent statewide, a little under 1 percent in the Pittsburgh area - but as is the case elsewhere, Hispanics are the fastest growing group, their numbers increasing 2 to 3 percent a year while most other groups are generally losing population. Magee Women's Hospital has enough Spanish-speaking patients to require the services of a part-time translator. Those who have been watching the trend agree that the last few years have been ones of steady growth, and suggest that the actual figures, if illegals were counted, would be much higher. Pittsburgh;s growing population of illegals mirrors a national trend. The United States is now home to more than 7 million Hispanics here illegally, according to Census Bureau estimates. The Hispanic population has grown significantly in the last year or so as the Mexican economy deteriorated, sending greater numbers across the border in search of work. With public anger over illegal immigration intensifying, Congress is now considering the adoption of the most restrictive changes in the country's immigration laws in 71 years. In addition, the federal government has for the past year stepped up its policing and surveillance of the Mexican border, seeking to choke off illegal crossings with limited success. No one knows how many of Pittsburgh's recent Hispanic arrivals are here illegally. While observers may disagree over the size and scope of the illegal population here, they agree that the majority of Latinos here are legal. Some marry U.S. citizens; some come on tourist visas and work for short periods, some get green cards and stay longer. And not all laborers are undocumented; many farm workers in the Pittsburgh area, for instance, are legal US. residents. And Pittsburgh's core Hispanic population has a high number of professionals and academics, people who are cosmopolitan, well-educated and bilingual. The newcomers, says Sague, are 'young — as young as 14 — they're bachelors, and they're coming for one thing: work.' Many left provincial towns in Mexico, El Salvador or Guatemala in search of work. Some tried to make it in Mexico City or other large metropolitan areas before deciding to go north. Some come to Pittsburgh because they have friends or relatives here. And apparently a number are coming with a job already in place. According to several people interviewed for this article, some Pittsburgh restaurateurs are a part of a network, illegal under US. federal law, in which border agencies link employers and would-be employees. 'The hire pays this agency $200, They the name and address of a place in the states. They have to pay their own way to get there, but once they do, they have a job, room and board,' says a Salvadoran who lives, here and is acquainted with a number of Mexicans and Central Americans here. Often the network is less formal. 'A restaurant has a Mexican dishwasher,' says Hector Mendoza, a Peruvian who res Ls in Pittsburgh for several years and worked in the restaurant business. He is married to an American. 'The owner says to him, ‘Do you have a cousin, a friend? Tell them to come, they can have a Job here.' It's all word of mouth.' That's how the 22-year-old man came, 'I was in Chicago for about two years. Then someone told me about a job here and I came for that,' he says. Rigoberto Hernandez also heard about a job in Pittsburgh after stints elsewhere. He's worked in Chicago, New York and California. A friend told him about a job in Squirrel Hill five years ago. He worked there for a couple of years, returned to his home in San Salvador for a year or so, and now he's back, working as a waiter in a Cranberry restaurant. His brother is a cook in a Mt. Lebanon restaurant. In a noisy bar on a cool Saturday night, Hernandez talked about his life. He wore shorts, loafers with no socks, a Dallas Cowboys T-shirt, Pirates cap, and drank a Coors Light. He says he has a green card that he paid a lawyer a lot of money to get. He likes Pittsburgh because it's 'tranquil' He is at ease with his life here, proud of his driver's license and growing mastery of things gringo. But he plans to return to his family in San Salvador, living there until it's time for another trip north, 'Esta bien aqui, esta bien alla' - 'It's good here, it's good there' - he says. Like his fellow workers, Hernandez puts in long hours, often from morning set-up to late night clean-up after closing, five or six days a week. The men interviewed for this article said they were paid either a flat monthly salary of $800 to $1,000 or an hourly rate from $1 to $6 — wages that are generally paid under the table. Hernandez earns $30 a day plus tips. With room and board provided by the restaurant owner, he's been able to send money home to San Salvador, buy a used sports car and return home by air. Others don't allow themselves even those luxuries. 'I've seen 12, 15 to a room,' Mendoza says. 'you come in and see rolled up foam pads lining the walls, This is their modus vivendi.' walk to work and rarely go out except lo send money and letters home. A number of people who work in mailing service stores said that they send money regularly for clients to Mexico and Central America. Yet for many, it is a big i improvement over anything they could get in their home country, The is one indication that the next phase in the typical immigration cycle Where the families brought to Join the immigrants — may be starting. Within a network of families with some connection to the Latino community, there are offers of child care or housecleaning from wives who have come to join their husbands here. And some men meet and fall in love with local women, and make their homes here. But Mendoza thinks the process of forming a true community will take a long time. 'These people come to work, not to make a life here.They work hard, send money home, and return home. When things get tough,they come again. They go home on a plane and return over the border.

'This isn't Chicago, where you have huge enterprises looking for labor.' Apart from the restaurants, apple orchards and pumpkin farms that are the major employers of Latinos here,work is scarce, says Kenneth Rodriguez, founder and chairman of the newly formed Pittsburgh Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. He believes more Latinos come not for itinerant work, but to go to school or for a specific job; to marry someone already living here; or to start a business. Where only a few years ago there were only a couple of Latin-owned-and-operated restaurants, there are now 16 in the Pittsburgh area, he says. There are more than 1,000 businesses owned or controlled by Hispanics in the metropolitan area. Whatever the source of population growth, there are indications that business providers and services are taking note. The downtown Greyhound bus station began putting its signs in Spanish a couple of years ago. Phone directories in the area have a few listings for lawyers specializing in immigration. Talent agencies are looking for Latino- looking models, Giant Eagle, USAir and other large corporations have joined the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, apparently foreseeing a greater Hispanic presence in this area Seated in the bar,the young man, who is from a small town north of Mexico City, says he misses his home, 'but there is nothing for me there.' “That is my home, but now Pittsburgh is my home, too,”",

Again in '82 he checked: The same few, 'By '93,' he says, 'there were 50. That's an exaggeration, but it's to say there were many.' When the U.S, Census comes to Pittsburgh next year it may be as surprised as Rodriguez was six years ago, especially if all the Latinos who are here are actually counted. Yesterday, Rodriguez, a co-founder and head of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Western Pennsylvania, assembled about 30 state officials and local Latinos for a 'town meeting' to devise strategies to avoid an under count in 2000. It was held in the chamber offices, in the former Alcoa Building, Downtown. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that it failed in 1990 to count 5.5 percent of the Latinos who lived in Pennsylvania, A '96 estimate of 292,060 Latinos in the state counted almost 11,000 in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh's Latino population is expected to have grown to about 15,000 by next year’s official U.S. Census count. Just one indication of this projection is the 86 Rodriguezes and Rodrigueses listings in the current phone book. Aside from the stable, longtime Latino population that has been counted for several decades and the more transient but expected migrations of Latinos through academia, the Latino population here is beginning to balance out with more vulnerable constituencies — those who are undocumented, unskilled or; because they speak little English and are underemployed, bouncing around in restaurant work and manual labor. Maritza Robert, executive director of the Governor's Advisory Commission for Latino Affairs, said the commission was committed to a true count and had assigned two staffers to work specifically with migrants. A majority of migrants are legally permitted to work, but the rest are well-represented among the estimated 10 percent of Latinos in Pennsylvania who are illegal. Census spokesmen yesterday stressed that people who are afraid — because they are illegal, have come from repressive regimes or are new here and don't know the rules — can be assured that all of the information they give a census taker will be confidential. Only their names will be entered in the immediate census record. By giving their names to a census taker, 'They can prove they were here,' and have a sort of grubstake in their long term potential to stay, said Robert. Census information is sealed for 72 years after the count. Title 13 of federal law requires it. A census worker can be fined and jailed for violating it. 'Not even the president of the United States has access to census information,' said Idalie Munoz Munoz, a specialist in a new U.S, Census Bureau program to dig deeper into the grass-roots level of communities and population groups that are traditionally hard to enumerate. The bureau also is now looking for bilingual census takers, Training is scheduled to begin next month, and the census count will begin early next year. Robert said the goal of the commission regarding the census was to ensure that Latinos are served. 'We pay a high price by not being counted. We lose out on education funds, health services, transportation and elder care,' she said. 'We cannot fail again not to be counted.' Yearly, $200 billion in federal money is distributed based purely on head count. 'Latinos have been an invisible people in terms of sharing the wealth,' said Munoz Munoz, who works in the regional office in Philadelphia. Philadelphia has a visible Latino presence of an estimated 89,000. That city has community-service agencies geared toward Latino needs and it has population concentrations. This is not true in Pittsburgh, where the population is highly scattered and no Latino community center has been established. 'There is a perception among people that Latinos come here to take advantage of the system,' she said. 'But people are here to better themselves.'",

It was a mouthful of family history that her new culture would soon pare down As her husband Ed went to work for his father selling coal-company Insurance in Greensburg, Maria de los Angeles Lopez-Portillo y Vernon de Stiteler set out to find Spanish speakers. These were the days before Lucy and Ricky on TV. That first Christmas, she called the University of Pittsburgh to invite people who spoke Spanish to her Mexican party, Pitt sent a U.S. born student of Mexican parents and his wife for what was undoubtedly the quietest Mexican fiesta in history 'I said, That's all?' Stiteler recalls of the meager showing. 'I was desperate to find people.' For more than 30 years, she taught Spanish at Seton Hill College, Today, retired in Pittsburgh, Stiteler belongs lo the most rapidly growing census group in the city, as well as the nation. By next year, the number of Latinos locally are projected to have at least doubled since 1990, when the U.S Census counted 8,700 Latinos in Allegheny County. This rate puts local Latinos in step with the national trend: Whether in 2015, 2010 or 2005 you hear all these dates - a projected 36 million Latinos very decidedly will represent the largest minority in the United States. Hispanic' is the government's official designation for their minority status and is preferred by many older Latinos, but used this way it neglects the Portuguese-speaking Brazilians, 'Latino' aligns aurally with Latin America, defined as the entire Western Hemisphere south of the United States The U.S Census Bureau considers 'Hispanic’ a subgroup; on most forms, the box appears down from 'black/white/other.' But Latinos represent an almost impossibly. hard to categorize splay of cultures. Like the rest of us, they are members of the great American mosaic. Imagine that tens of millions of United States and Canadian citizens went to a country that counted them under the name ‘Usas.' With roots all over the world, we would be black, white, parts of both, indigenous and all jammed into the box marked 'Usas.' We would stop each other on the street and talk like lost cousins. We might hold festivals to celebrate our common bonds, As Usas, an African-American from California, a French-speaking Quebecois and an Appalachian Presbyterian would have more in common than ever before. This is how Latinos find themselves and each other in the United States today - a tremendous melange whose numbers are growing at a rate seven times faster than the whole. Newsweek reported in July that nationally, the Latino population has grown by 38 percent since 1990, mostly with legal immigration. On a chart of the state's cities (see page G-13), horizontal bands represent the reach of each city's Latino population as of 1994. Lancaster's the winner, its 20.6 percent beating Reading's18.5 percent by a half inch. York, West Chester and Harrisburg all line up at 7-plus percent, outdistancing Philadelphia's 5.6 percent.  Furthest left, barely out of the gate, a notch represents Pittsburgh's 0.9 percent Latinos. But even in a Latino microcosm as micro as Pittsburgh, this diverse subgroup finally feels the support of a national trend that acknowledges the dynamic force they are bringing to bear on the United States.",

It will be a killer of a day On the road in a rented green van by 6 a.m. for Pennsylvania Latino Day in Washington, D.C., back home after midnight Seventy-five Latinos statewide will bring issues to the conference room in the Hart Senate Office Building. Senators Rick Santorum, Arlen Specter and Utah's Orrin Hatch will man the podium Hatch is on the Senate's Republican Task Force on Hispanic Affairs. Born in Pittsburgh, call ing himself 'Pennsylvania’s third senator,' he will tell his story about living in a South Hills chicken coop in an effort to ally himself with the struggle of underprivileged Latinos. Inexplicably, he will say he considers himself a Latino. But the assembly — most from eastern Pennsylvania — is worried about Latino children, whose public school drop-out rate of 6.7 percent almost triples the state average; concerned about the disparate levels of commitment to their health care and about diabetes, an oft-cited 'Latino' disease; appalled that though they make up less than 5 percent of the state's population, their brethren contribute at least more than double that percentage to the state's prisons. Before the green van plowed home in a heavy rain that night, a little dream of Pittsburgh got voice. Brent Rondon, president of the Latin American Cultural Union (LACU), stood and told the assembly that Pittsburgh's Latino population is dispersed and without a focal point: 'We want to pursue funding, maybe a grant, to establish a community center. In Pittsburgh, we have no ‘place.’ ' The Latino presence in most cities is concentrated in neighborhoods called barrios, where cuisine, shopping and support services cater to them. In such a community center in Harrisburg, Rondon began learning English when he came from Peru 11 years ago, The timing of Rondon's proposal coincides with a changing Latino demographic in Pittsburgh: 'In the last six or seven years,' he told the assembly, 'we have seen a growth in our population of workers in jobs that are not professional.' Unlike Pittsburgh's earlier phalanx of Latinos, this population will struggle longer for position, for a second language and for a sense of community. Long-time Latino residents say they see new faces in dance clubs and at the grocery store. They see men they're sure are fellow Latinos walking with lunch pails and Latinos boarding buses with their children. These are the people who most need a place, says Rondon; the reason there was never a barrio was because the professional classes never needed one, 'My vision is of a place where people could be free to stop by and get help and advice,' he says. 'I know a doctor who told me he is willing to do free consulting, but where? Women who are isolated with children need day care so they could learn English better or explore opportunities, Our center could have day care.' The center would also need a Staff. Rondon devotes time to LACU in addition to a job managing international programs for Duquesne University's Small Business Development Center: But he has been as influential as anyone in the blossoming of Latino cultural presence in the city. LACU members dance at fundraisers, holiday events and festivals. They team with The Andy Warhol Museum for Day of the Dead celebrations and exhibits Their authentic cultural displays have helped build esteem for the annual Latin American Folk Festival at the University of Pittsburgh. For now, the Latino presence is portable, People flutter to the flame of a variety of clubs and restaurants that didn't exist 10 years ago — Cozumel and the Fajita Grill in Shadyside, Kenny B's Downtown, La Fiesta in Oakland, Mago Latino in Bloomfield, El Campesano in Monroeville, Club Rios on Mount Washington and Club Havana in Shadyside. At a new South Side club, Angels, one of the managers is former Pirates catcher Manny Sanguillen. This little bloom of night life has given rise to several Latino bands. Miguel Sagué's Guaracha is the most venerable, dating to the late ‘70s. More recently, Orquesta Tropical, Latin impulse and the traditional Andean band Musuhalpa have gained footholds. Sague, Cuban born and Erie raised, has built Guaracha into a cross-over band since the late '70s. The Gateway Clipper hired them for dinner cruises, and Sagué brought dancers from LACU aboard. In the early '90s, impresario and musician Karl Mullen began booking Guaracha at Rosebud in the Strip, where the very first Latino night led to more at other clubs. Now, almost every night of the week, if you want to dance salsa or merengue, you can find dance partners and instructors at various clubs in the city. At the same time, the Latino presence here risks being defined within the almost clichéd confines of salsa dancing and salsa dip. Latinos have not made an intensive claim on this city, partly because no barrio was ever established, partly because the professionals who made up most of the Latino population for so long didn't project their being Latino on the rest of the city. Many non-Latinos think the chicken enchilada they always order is an ethnic experience, They may never know about pigeon peas, fritters or seafood stew. Many non-Latinos believe all Latinos are Catholic, but significant numbers belong to Mennonite, Jewish, Evangelical and other congregations. Further, if you think someone looks Latino, his accent may be a better indicator Patricia Documet, a Peruvian native and doctoral student in public health at Pitt, says, 'People ask if my children are Chinese because their hair is straight and black and their eyes go up a little.' Documet, like most Peruvians, is part Indian. Mexican-born Juan Bravo, CEO of Harbison-Walker Refractory Co., says, 'I'm a Mexican of Italian descent, but when I'm in London, everyone confuses me with being an Arab. My wife was speaking Spanish with our daughter one day in the supermarket, and someone asked if she was a migrant worker.' Because Latinos are considered a minority group, they often are misperceived as a separate race, but an estimated 25 percent of Latin Americans are African Americans. The dominant European ancestry is Spanish, with American Indian ancestry dominant in Peru, Guatemala, Ecuador and Bolivia. Juana Roman of Peru develops art-related mentorship for at risk youth at the Manchester Craftsman's Guild. When Pedro Meyer, a Mexican photographer, exhibited there, the African American children in the program interviewed him in their public-school Spanish. They had not previously considered the link between African and Latin Americans, Roman said. Through the outreach program of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Latin American Studies, children at Miller Elementary, in the Hill District, have for two years been learning capoeira, a Brazilian form of martial arts dance and discipline with roots in Angola. Kenya Dworkin, an assistant professor of Spanish at Carnegie Mellon University, is the Cuban born daughter of a Cuban mother and a father whose Jewish family fled Poland in the '30s, She recalls two of her daughter's experiences in race relations at school: 'When she went to middle school, she was asked what she was, One frustrated classmate said, 'You have to pick black or white.' Later in high school, a teacher would not let her write about a Cuban general for Black History Month: 'She said he wasn't an American.’ Pittsburgh's most visible Latinos have always been Pittsburgh Pirates. The former 6th Street Bridge now bears the name of the most famous of all, Roberto Clemente. Another, Sanguillen, has lived here off and on since his playing days in the '70s. The current roster of Latinos includes Jose Silva, an American-born Mexican, Abrahim Nunez, a Dominican, and Francisco Cordova of Mexico. In spite of their glamorous status, some Latino players live in isolation, talking only to each other; not venturing out much; shy of fans who speak English. During Clemente's first years in Pittsburgh, as he struggled to be cogent in his second language and was chided in print for his accent, Edward Litchfield was building an empire in the neighborhood where he played. Litchfield, the chancellor at Pitt from 1956-65, believed in the importance of having Latin America in that empire. Latin America made its academic debut at Pitt when the national psyche was occupied with the Soviet Union and Vietnam, Today, the 35-year-old Center for Latin American Studies bears witness to Litchfield’s prescience. He hired Cole Blasier, a prominent scholar who had Latin-American foreign service experience, to build the center: Blasier hired Eduardo Lozano, an Argentine who has for 30 years been developing a Latin-American collection of books that number now about 380,000 volumes. It is one of the 10 largest such collections in the country. Carmelo Mesa-Lago became the center's second director in 1977, nine years after assisting Blasier. In charge of social security reform for the Cuban government before Castro, he fled his country in 1961, at age 27- Previously a lawyer and a professor, he received a Ph.D. in economics from Cornell University. During his tenure as director, government funds brought Latin-American engineers to study at Pitt in exchange for Pitt engineers, and the medical school began recruiting doctors from Latin America. A film buff, Mesa-Lago started the Latin American Film Festival in 1968 and, in the early ‘70s, a Latin-American theater series. The center also sponsored art exhibits at the Frick under his direction and established the first Latin American Folk Festival Brent Rondon remembers that festival, just a few weekends after he arrived in Pittsburgh for classes at Pitt. 'I remember thinking, ‘Wow, this is great, There must a lot of Latinos in Pittsburgh.' If that ever seems so, it seems so in Oakland, where Latinos are seen and heard the most. For about 20 years, the Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese has offered 1 p.m. Sunday Masses in Spanish at the Cardinal Dearden Center. The service was set in Oakland because of the number of Spanish speakers in academia, but Rev. Bill Lies said the congregation has grown in recent years from 40-60 a week to about 120-150, with many new faces 'It's more of a trickle than a wave, but it is something.' Spanish and Portuguese can be heard on the radio, too. Four years ago, the program director at Carnegie Mellon University's radio station wanted to fill an open slot with a program in Spanish. Martha Mantilla, a Colombian, was starting doctoral work in education. A friend convinced her to take the slot. She and another doctoral student designed a program of news, music, sports program Latin America and community event announcements, The Latin American Radio Magazine airs on WRCTFM (88.3) from 6 to 7 p.m. on Mondays. The last Monday of each month, Brazilian Carla Murillo is host of the show in Portuguese. The 300 or so local Brazilians, whose tongue is very similar to Spanish, nevertheless find solace in their own community. A music and dance group sprang from a Brazil Nuts Portuguese Club at Pitt, and many of the members are non-students, Murillo said. Students, grad students, researchers, doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs and other professionals have long contributed most to Pittsburgh's unique Latino makeup. But one drawback of academia as your greatest lure is the exodus, After two- and three-year programs, many take their training to larger cities or back to Latin America. Echoing many, Mantilla says, 'I don't know yet whether I will stay. I hope to finish my dissertation in a year. But I like the mix of cultures here. It seems there's room for people.' As Rondon and others hash out plans for a Latino community center, the city’s third most notable Latino-focused entity is reconsidering its mission. The Hispanic Chamber of Commerce formed in 1894 around the business interests of three men, Kenneth Rodriguez, Tomas Vasquez and Gilberto Zavala. Rodriguez, the chamber's chairman, came to Pittsburgh in the '70s and '80s to manage construction projects for a New Jersey firm. In 1993, he convinced the firm to open an office here. He has since started his own company for international trade, Rodriguez & Offspring Enterprises on the North Side, and lives in Beaver. 'We were trying to be in business, having obstacles with the language and issues particular to us,' says Zavala, whose company, Zavala Inc. has been named Hispanic magazine's 18th fastest growing Latino-owned business in the United States. A contractor of traffic and highway sign structures and street lighting, Zavala reported revenues of $3.5 million in 1999, a 116 percent growth rate over 1998. Zavala met his wife, a Pittsburgher, while both were in college in Monterrey, Mexico. After college, his wife suggested they spend the summer here. 'The summer turned into a year into a life,' he says. At the time, he saw the same three or four Latinos, SEE LATINOS, PAGE G-13",

'Suddenly, they are popping up everywhere,' In 1993, he was laid off as a project engineer for a construction company. So far from home and committed to a rooted family, he says, 'you sink or swim.' With emotional support from Rundriguez and Vasquez, their fledgling business association became a network that was as much social as anything. Others joined, but as their businesses took off, they didn't need the benefits of each others’ contacts and found less lime to devote to the chamber. Today, the chambers 23 members include PNC Bank. the Port Authority and People’s Natural Gas, companies the chamber helps recruit Latino employees and helps make contacts for businesses Latin America. Its president and vice president are not Latinos, which worries a few members who are. But one chamber goal for greater efficacy is to strengthen its ties to the advocates of Latino culture, namely LACU. Rob Jones, the chamber vice president and a manager at Consolidated Natural Gas, says he wants a neon sign at the entrance to the Fort Pitt Tunnel that reads 'Bienvenidos!' — 'Welcome' — in Spanish. The chamber's impetus to plan a new future is based in part, says Rodriguez, 'on who we are.' A survey he took of Latino households several years ago showed that they were almost $20,000 richer than the average $45,000-a- year in Pittsburgh. Lately, it has become clear that 'who we are' is increasingly the troubled and invisible Latino. One day in May, a Mexican family called the chamber. They may have been referred by police. . The family's son had been in Pittsburgh, undocumented, perhaps working in food service. He and three other young Mexican men got info an argument one weekend night in Bloomfield and one pulled a gun. The son and another of the men were killed, The family couldn't afford to fly the son's body to Mexico and asked the chamber for help. To Rodriguez, this was an example of there being too few services for Latinos. Another call not long ago further confirmed his place. A restaurant owner called the chamber to report that some antagonists outside a bar spotted an employee of his walking to work. The man was obviously ethnic, in fact a Mexican, said Rodriguez, 'and they beat the hell out of him.' The restaurant owner asked Rodriguez what he should do, 'I said 'Take him to the damn hospital' But the owner, who claimed he didn't know his worker was undocumented, was afraid of being fined by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS reports the undocumented population is up. A 1996 report of an estimated 37,000 statewide did not specify countries of origin. George Hess, officer in charge of the INS office in Pittsburgh, says, 'It is my perception that we have more illegal Mexican nationals working in the area.' The most common work places, he said, are Chinese restaurants, construction sites, in landscaping and agriculture, But when people call INS to report seeing illegal Mexicans in these jobs, he asks them, 'How do you know they're not legal?' Legal non-citizens carry any of several documents. For the past several years, all green need to be renewed, with updated photos. Work and tourist visas are granted for various lengths of stay. People can qualify for immigrant status through established family or an employer-advocate. Another class, refugees, can get a green card after a year Most large cities’ Latinos were laborers first and foremost. In Chicago it was railroads, in Los Angeles, agriculture, and in New York, waves of Puerto Ricans sought opportunities after World War II. Pittsburgh never lured large numbers, Steel mills were filled with European émigrés. Southeastern Pennsylvania attracted many Latinos to the mushroom industry, and northeastern cities have experienced run-off from New York and New Jersey. The earliest groups of Latinos in Western Pennsylvania were Puerto Rican grape pickers around Erie and the hundreds of Mexican men the railroads would load up and haul north for breaking strikes. The U.S. Census Bureau has staff in the field to improve on the 1990 count. But furtive Latinos will need convincing that being counted doesn't mean being found out. Beyond one's name, details on a census form are sealed for 72 years. Being counted is a record of proof of residence in case of future naturalization. A true count also will help the Latino population get all the federal moneys and services due them. The U.S, Census Bureau, in a follow up to the 1990 census, estimalted that it missed counting 5.5 percent of the state's Latinos. Crimes like the ones reported to the Hispanic chamber are less common than crimes Latinos are committing. The Department of Corrections reports that of 36,523 prisoners in the state system, 4,346 are Latinos. At 11.9 percent, that’s more than double the percentage of the state's Latino population. Jamil Assaf-Bautista, a management consultant in Philadelphia, is researching a hook on the subject. His interviews indicate that one-third of the state's population behind bars is Latino. And while many Latinos inhabit what he calls 'a failure environment,' he believes police have 'a visual fixation' against types and would be more inclined to haul in a Lat no for a minor offense than 'an Anglo in a Volvo.' 'I'm not making excuses, I want a solution,' he says, citing high-school drop-out rates: In Philadelphia, for instance, the rate is 71 percent. The national average for Latinos is 65 percent. 'At the rate we are going, our people are helping to fill a lucrative prison industry.' Drop-out rates are not Pittsburgh problems; the city’s public school system doesn't signify ethnic categories for drop-outs, and of 40,000 children in city schools, just 164 at most recent count, in '98, were Latino, Crime also doesn't rate a problem, say police, but advocates here are concerned about the local incarcerations of Latinos, Sergio Pinto, a native Guatemalan, once used his Spanish for children on 'Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.' Most recently, he has been using his Spanish in the Allegheny County jails and in court, for the federal public defender’s office 'Not all Latinos are dancing at Cozumel,' says Pinto, whose full- time work is running the 31-language Multinational Translation Services, with offices here and in Washington, D.C. 'The Hispanic jail population is growing,' he said, adding that the majority of his clients are in for drugs and shoplifting. Without language intervention, many would move through the system not understanding a word being said. 'In cities with more Latinos, there are more instruments of support for the ones in need.' he said. 'The Latinos in need here are invisible.' It took numerous phone calls to the Allegheny County Jail to gel no call backs or information about the numbers of Latinos processed in recent years. Sheley Stark, chief of the federal public defender's office, said the numbers of Latinos in the federal system has not seemed inordinately high. But she said, 'I have heard horror stories about people sitting in jail for months.' Pinto and other advocates speculate on the comparative disadvantages of being a Latino in a traffic stop, but the Pittsburgh. Police Department is trying to counter criticism, It runs an outs reach program, with help and oversight from the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Sgt. Lavonnie Bickerstaff has both recruited employees and led cultural diversity classes for Chief Robert McNeilly, She says, the department employs at least five Latino officers and several non-Latinos who speak Spanish 'The criminal element is quite small, but we have seen an increasing number of Latino surnames on reports,' as victims of universal kinds of crime, such as car and house burglaries and stolen property, she said. One Pittsburgh agency has already started an outreach effort, largely 10 help families avoid problems that lead to family breakdowns. Family Resources, based in East Liberty; created a Latin-American Family Outreach service last year with a grant from the Allegheny County Mental Health Department. The grant was renewed this year for $30,702. Salome Servian leads the out: reach, which has advised 'hundreds of families and worked with about 50.' With her focus on pres venting domestic abuse, she deals with universal Latino issues, including the stress of culture shock, language limitations and feelings of isolation Servian, of Paraguay, advertised the service by appearing at festivals and at the Spanish Mass on Sundays. 'We need more Spanish-speaking volunteers because we are looking at more need. The population is definitely growing 'I know This, because at our agency picnic, you wouldn't believe all the children.'

    cardSubtitle: "",
    cardDetailedText: "When Eduardo Lozano arrived at the University of Pittsburgh in 1967 to help develop a Latin American collection in conjunction with the university's new Center for Latin American Studies, he was only supposed to stay for a year. More than 30 years later, Lozano, librarian for Latin American Studies at Pitt, is still working on what has become the eighth largest collection of Latin American re- source materials — literature, periodicals, dissertations, maps, recordings, videos and films — in the United States. Yesterday, he and about 70 others dedicated the center's Latin American Reading Room, which has been at least a decade in the making. The reading room, located on the first floor of Pitt's Hi Library, houses only a fraction of the collection's 420,000 volumes, from every country in Central and South America. People from all over the world come to Pitt to use the collections material on Bolivia, said Lozano, & native of Argentina. 'We've been talking about a room ever since I came here eight years ago — I think even before I came here,' said Rush Miller, director of Pitt's University Library Services. The [Center for Latin American Studies] wanted a more visible center in the library for Latin American students.' When the library moved a collection from the first floor into the Cup and Chaucer Cafe on the lower level, space became available for the Latin American reading room, With its sand-colored arches and columns and windows on three sides, the room, designed by Peruvian native Victor Beltran of L.D. Astorine & Associates Lid. of Pittsburgh, is reminiscent of a Spanish courtyard. Beltran said because the Spanish arches and columns are so much a part of Latin American architecture, he wanted to use them to create a space that would make Latin American students and professors feel at home. 'It's wonderful to have a space that's a tangible manifestation of our program,' said Kathleen DeWalt, director of the Center for Latin American Studies. She said such a room has been the dream of each of her predecessors, including her husband. Billie DeWalt, who headed the center for eight years before becoming director pf the Carnegie Museum of Natural History 'This is exactly the kind of thing we envisioned when we started out four or five years ago.' said Billie DeWalt, who was instrumental in getting the project started Brazilian native Haydee Esteves Belda, who with husband Alain Belda, chairman and chief executive officer of Alcoa, is among the mom's funders, said, 'I think this is so important for the city and for the university and for Latin America to be represented in this fashion. Our culture is in very good hands here.'",
