                <p>The Pittsburgh Transformations Project is a collaborative and multidisciplinary study focusing on the historical and contemporary challenges faced by three underrepresented U.S. populations in Western Pennsylvania: Black American, Asian American, and Latinx communities.</p>
                <p>This project includes a collection of interviews with residents and Pitt students who identify with one or more of the underrepresented populations. With over seventy participants, these interviews provide insights on the realities that communities of color experience in the area. The interview transcriptions are housed in the University of Pittsburgh Library Archives.</p>
                <p>Within this platform, explore a digital archive, a racial/ethnic demographic map, and audio documentaries on each population. Ultimately, the Transformations Project aims to encourage community dialogues on crucial topics such as race, ethnicity, migration, health, and education within the region.</p>
